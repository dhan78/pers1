19049	20080421	1330	1	Welcome to today’s teleconference. (Operator Instructions) I’ll now turn the program over to Mr. Kevin Stitt; please begin sir.  
19049	20080421	1330	2	Good morning. This is Kevin Stitt, Bank of America Investor Relations. Before Kenneth Lewis and Joe Price begin their comments let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include among other things changes in economic conditions; changes in credit quality; changes in interest rates; competitor pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors please see our press release and SEC documents.   And with that let me turn it over to Kenneth Lewis.  
19049	20080421	1330	3	Good morning. I’m going to touch on some of the drivers affecting earnings in the first quarter and highlight results of our main businesses. Joe will then dig a little deeper into some of the issues identified along with further discussion about capital markets and advisory services, credit quality, the balance sheet and of course capital.   Although consumer and commercial business flows were relatively strong in the first quarter revaluations of structured credit positions and higher credit costs more than offset these positives. By now you know that the businesses within capital markets were once again negatively impacted by continued market disruptions and dislocations like we experienced in the second half of last year. In addition first quarter reflected weaker housing markets particularly in geographic regions that experienced significant home price declines.  This weakening along with the slowing economy has resulted in credit deterioration in our consumer portfolios particularly home equity and small business along with home builders on the commercial side.   For the first quarter of 2008 Bank of America earned $1.2 billion or $0.23 per diluted share which included after-tax merger charges of $107 million or $0.02. Major items in the quarter included issuance of approximately $13 billion in capital in January bringing our Tier 1 ratio to 7.51%; a positive impact related to the VISA IPO; a significant increase in provision expense which resulted or included $3.3 billion of reserve increase; additional write-downs involving our super senior CDL and subprime related exposure, the leverage lending book and the CMBS book which all together totaled a little over $2 billion and finally additional support to the Columbia cash funds of $220 million.  While the litany of negative issues left a clear mark on earnings there were bright spots within our core retail commercial banking and investment banking businesses that indicate ongoing stability and recurring earnings power. Looking specifically at global consumer and small business banking earnings of $1.1 billion for the first quarter were down almost 60% from a year ago. This drop was due to a $4 billion increase in provision which more than offset a 17% in increase in revenue with minimal impact from LaSalle.   Revenue actually increased 3% excluding the VISA gain from the fourth quarter which we think is noteworthy given that the comparison of fourth quarter first quarter is normally a decrease due to seasonality. Compared to a year ago non interest income grew 21% excluding the VISA gain due to good performance in all categories. We increased the allowance for loan losses in the consumer businesses by approximately $2.8 billion due mainly to ongoing weaknesses in the housing market and the economy along with seasoning of several growth portfolios which Joe will discuss.  Product sales were strong in several areas with net new checking accounts of 557,000 exceeding the total from a year ago by 14%. In residential mortgage the rate environment in early January caused somewhat of a mini refi boom that resulted in $23 billion of directed consumer fundings which was the strongest activity we had experienced in five years. There was evidence in the fourth quarter that we were beginning to regain some traction in retail deposit growth after several quarters of sluggish results and this evidence became more pronounced in the first quarter.   Average retail deposits increased approximately $11.5 billion or 2.3% from the fourth quarter which we believe exceeds market growth. We maintained our number one ranking as card services lender in the US and UK with average managed consumer credit card outstandings up 3% from the fourth quarter and 10% from a year ago.   Even though the economy is slow we continue to add new retail customers and expand our relationships with existing customers which is a trend we have been demonstrating over the past few quarters.   Global wealth and investment management earned $228 million in the first quarter as revenue growth of 8% versus a year ago was impacted by the cash fund support of $220 million. In addition provision increased $220 million related to housing pressures on home equity loans. On the positive side asset management fees and GWIM increased 6% from a year ago after adjusting for the businesses we either added US Trust and LaSalle or sold Marsico. The integration of US Trust continues to be on schedule and will be substantially completed in the second quarter.   Premier banking and investments experienced good growth in brokerage income, fee based assets, loan production and deposit levels. Loans with premier customers rose 14% from a year ago with organic growth in deposits up 6%. Assets under management and GWIM closed the quarter at $607 billion about flat with a year ago after adjusting for businesses we’d added or sold.  Strong inflows including $13 billion into equity funds over the past 12 months were offset by negative market performance. Global corporate investment banking earned $115 million in the first quarter reflecting the negative impact of events in the financial and housing markets, although net income is up significantly from fourth quarter it is down from $1.5 billion a year ago.   For the quarter C mass lost $1.1 billion versus earning $528 million a year ago driving the loss for the markdowns I referenced earlier. Otherwise our investment bank had good client activity with investment banking fees of $665 million reflecting good results in equity underwriting and investment grade issuance.   Excluding C mass the rest of GCIB and that’s mainly lending and treasury services, earning $1.2 billion during the quarter up slightly from a year ago after adjusting for the VISA gain. Good client activity and the addition of LaSalle more than offset an increase in provision expense. Client activity drove an 11% organic growth in loans and better spreads. Not included in the three business segments is equity investment income of $268 million in the first quarter. This is below our range of $300 million to $400 million we talked about in January due to less liquidity in the markets.  Now before I turn it over to Joe, let me make a couple of comments about our thinking given the current environment. As you realize by now first quarter was much worse than our expectations three months ago with the most notable deterioration in the latter part of the quarter. The issues we faced in capital markets in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter with March being particularly difficult.   Consumer credit quality deteriorated substantially from fourth quarter particularly in home equity. Going forward we believe actions by the Fed along with the eventual stabilization of home values should help the capital markets improve although not back to levels we experienced in 2006 and the first half of 2007. But even this will take time. Credit quality will continue to be an issue with charge-offs at least at first quarter levels but probably higher for the rest of the year.  While we don’t expect to increase reserves at the pace we experienced over the past two quarters our reserving actions will correlate with the direction of the economy and its impact on our customers. Our economic expectations project minimal GDP growth if not contraction in the second quarter and only a slight pickup in the second half of 2008. Results from LaSalle continue to be positive and while the slower economic environment is having some impact things were generally in line with our expectations.  We expect to close Countrywide early in the third quarter given regulatory approval and an affirmative vote by Countrywide shareholders. We believe the current CDO values are appropriate but are always subject to [approval] changes based on market conditions. Our Tier 1 capital ratio closed the quarter at 7.51% up from 6.87% at year-end.   Our goal continues to be getting back to our target of 8% and we plan to do that through earnings generation and no share repurchases. Now instead of just focusing in on one capital ratio, we measure capital strength from several perspectives including total shareholders equity of %156 billion as well as the allowance for loan losses of $15 billion. And as evidenced by some recent events I think we were all reminded that capital is only meaningful when combined with liquidity strength. We continue to maintain an abundance of liquidity at our holding company where our time to require funding stands at 20 months; significantly higher than others.   Given these parameters our outlook for the economy and our earnings potential we have not changed our philosophy about the dividend. But if the economy worsens dramatically from our outlook over the next few quarters resulting in a prolonged recessionary environment we would do what we think prudent to manage capital.   We of course remained concerned about the health of the consumer given the prolonged housing slump, subprime issues, employment levels and high fuel and food prices. The drivers of our earnings for the remainder of the year will be our core businesses of retail banking, card, commercial banking, treasury services and asset management along with a tight grip on expense levels across the corporation.   When I became CEO seven years ago, my goal was to build a franchise centered on prime US consumer and commercial customers. The groundwork for this franchise has centered on improving customer satisfaction, expanding our retail presence in card and in the North East and improving efficiency including the use of sic sigma. To address risk we exited subprime origination in 2001 and reduced our exposure to large corporate lending. All of those actions have provided us with a franchise that we think is the best in the world in financial services and centered on the US customer but of course exposed to the ups and downs of the US economy.  While the current environment is the most challenging I have dealt with and while our US customer base is showing some weakness I firmly believe that the earnings power of the Bank of America model remain intact over the long-term. Most importantly we remain committed to serving our customers and clients while driving profitability during these tougher times.  And with that I’ll turn it over to Joe.  
19049	20080421	1330	4	Thanks Ken. Let me begin by taking a minute to elaborate further on some of the larger items affecting this quarter’s results. First the VISA IPO gain which is reflected in equity investment income at $776 million is split between our card business and treasury services excluding the reversal of related litigation costs. Much of the expense drop from the fourth quarter was related to book and the VISA litigation expense in the fourth quarter and then subsequently reversing that charge in the first quarter.  Pushing expense levels the other way was the negative impact of FAS 123-R or $256 million in incentive expense which happens in the first quarter of every year when [effort] rewards are granted. Provision expense rose to $6 billion and included additions to reserves of $3.3 billion.   Now let me turn to GCIB and address the write-downs in capital markets and advisory services. C mass had a loss this quarter of $1.1 billion as revenues declined $3 billion from a year ago but increased almost $3.9 billion from the fourth quarter. Investment banking fees were pretty good and although down from a year ago were notable given the tough market conditions. total revenue in C mass excluding investment banking fees or what we call sales and trading revenue, was a negative $1.3 billion as write-downs in several areas offset strong performance in interest rate products, foreign exchange and equities.   Now addressing the write-downs let me start with leverage lending where we ended the quarter with exposure of just under $13.5 billion; $3.9 billion unfunded and $9.6 billion funded which included new commitments of $1 billion as we continued to do new business on current market terms. We actually did about $3.5 billion in new business with $1 billion left in the pipeline at quarter-end.   During the quarter we wrote down an additional $435 million as market pricing continued to fall especially late in the quarter. As a reminder we don’t have any covenant light expose of note and over 60% is senior secured. Since quarter-end we’ve sold about $1.3 billion of exposure and did not provide financing with those transactions and we’re beginning to see some signs of increased liquidity in this market.   On the CMBS side we ended the quarter with just under $12 billion in exposure which includes about $1 billion unfunded. Approximately three-fours or $9 billion is comprised of larger ticket floating rate debt most of which was acquisition-related. This floating rate debt was written down by $212 million in the first quarter net of $35 million in hedging gains. This product is a little more difficult to hedge as compared to the remaining $3 billion of exposure which is primarily fixed rate conduit product.   During the quarter we actually had a net gain of $21 million on the fixed rate exposure, $396 million in write-downs offset by $417 million in hedging gains. The third area that hit us pretty hard this quarter relates to the structured credit trading book which we were winding down. During the quarter we neutralized a good deal of the market risk but widening credit spreads and increasing counter party exposure caused us to record counter party credit valuations of a negative $272 million.   Finally in the supplemental package you can see our CDO and subprime related exposure along with the changes during the quarter where we recorded losses of $1.5 billion. These losses were comprised of $1.6 billion in super senior CDO write-downs offset by $400 million in hedging and other gains, a charge of $160 million to reflect counter party risk and $130 million in losses associated with our CDO warehouse and subprime exposure.  At the end of March our net subprime super senior related exposure dropped to $5.9 billion from $8.2 billion at the end of the year reflecting the write-downs along with reductions of another $800 million due to liquidations, cancellations and pay-downs. At this point we see liquidations accelerating during the second quarter whereby we will most likely take possession of the underlying asset backed securities.   During the quarter we took about $500 million on to the desk as part of liquidations at about $0.50 on the dollar or $250 million. Additionally CDO warehouse exposure is down to about $200 million and other subprime exposure is also around $200 million both reflecting [carrying] values of about $0.35 on the dollar. Although we remain subject to market price fluctuations we think the worst is behind us on these value declines. We continue to believe that once we work through these exposures and as the market trends back towards some level of normalcy we can achieve the earnings objectives we laid out for you last quarter when we discussed our C mass restructuring plan which in summary were revenue levels in line with the results we generated in 2005.  Now let me switch to credit quality. On a HEL basis net charge-offs in the quarter increased 34 basis points from the fourth quarter levels to 1.25% of the portfolio or $2.7 billion. On a managed basis overall consolidated net losses in the quarter increased 35 basis points to 1.69% of the managed loan portfolio or $4.1 billion. Net losses in the consumer portfolios were 2.19% versus 1.77% in the fourth quarter. Credit card represents almost two-thirds of our total consumer losses. Managed consumer credit card losses as a percent of the portfolio increased to 5.19% from 4.75% in the fourth quarter which was a little better on a percentage basis than we expected but admittedly was driven by balance growth as opposed to lower losses.   Thirty-day plus delinquencies in consumer credit card increased 16 basis points to 5.61% and we’ve continued to see increased delinquencies in our card portfolio and those states most affected by housing problems. California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona make up a little more than a quarter of our domestic consumer card book. Credit quality in our consumer real estate, mainly home equity deteriorated sharply in the first quarter as a result of the weaker housing market.   The problems to date have been centered in higher LTV home equity loans particularly in states that have experienced significant decreases in home prices. Almost all these states have been growth markets in the past several years. Our largest concentrations are in California and Florida. Home equity net charge-offs increased to $496 million or 1.71% up from 63 basis points in the prior quarter. Thirty-day performing delinquencies are up seven basis points to 1.33%. Non-performing loans in home equity rose to 1.51% of the portfolio from 1.17% in the prior quarter.  Eighty-two percent of net charge-offs related to loans where the borrower was delinquent and had little or no equity in the home. Loans with a greater than 90% CLTV on a refreshed basis currently represent 26% of loans versus 21% in the fourth quarter. This change reflects the continued decline in home prices most acutely in the states I noted earlier. Like others in the industry a material piece of the deterioration is centered in loans not originated through the franchise. These purchased loans represent only 3% of the portfolio but 20% of the net charge-offs in the quarter.  As we mentioned last quarter we discontinued such purchases in the second quarter of 2007. Excluding these loans the net charge-off rate would be 1.41% and 52 basis points for the first quarter and first quarter respectively versus the reported 1.71% and 63 basis points respectively for the portfolio. We believe net charge-offs in home equity will continue to rise given softness in the real estate values and seasoning in the portfolio.   We increased reserves for this portfolio to 215 basis points reflecting the continued elevate level of delinquency rolls, loss occurrences and loss severities. As a result we would expect to see losses cross the 200 basis point mark by the middle of this year as we work through these issues.   Now we’ve instituted a number of initiatives to mitigate risk in new originations as well as existing exposure including lower maximum CLTVs across both geography and borrower. Two issues that plague home equity and drive losses higher are prolonged deterioration along with further deterioration in the economy.  Our residential mortgage portfolio showed an increase in losses to $66 million or 10 basis points for the quarter but continues to perform well. While we’ve seen some deterioration in sub-segments namely our community reinvestment act portfolio that totals some 8% of the book nothing really stands out to us at this point. Let me remind you that approximately $161 billion or more than 60% of our residential mortgage portfolio carries risk mitigation protection. Of that amount approximately 80% is protected where we sell second loss exposures to cash collateralized structures where we have no counter party risk and the remaining 20% is with GSEs.   Our auto portfolio at the end of March was about $25 billion in loans. Net losses in the quarter were $101 million or an annualized 1.65% of the portfolio which is up 12 basis points or $2 million from the fourth quarter related to deterioration in the most stressed housing markets.   Switching to our commercial portfolios, net charge-offs increased in the quarter to $556 million or 69 basis points up 22 basis points from the fourth quarter. Almost all the deterioration is driven by small business and home builders with the other portfolios remaining relatively sound. Net losses in small business which are reported as commercial loan losses are up $78 million from the fourth quarter and the net charge-off rate has risen to 7.21%. As we’ve discussed before many of the issues in small business relate to how we grew the portfolio over the past few years which is now compounded by the current economic trends. As we also highlighted we have since instituted a number of underwriting changes such as increasing the level of judgmental credit decisioning, lowering initial line assignments and changing our direct mail offerings.   These actions have resulted in an increase in average FICO at origination, a reduction in average line amounts and a meaningful drop in approval rates. While it will take some time to work through these earlier vintages small business remains a critical customer segment with attractive profitable growth opportunities.  Excluding small business commercial net charge-offs increased $97 million from the fourth quarter to $197 million representing a charge-off ratio of 26 basis points. Ninety million of the $97 million increase was driven by commercial real estate and more than half of the increase represented one credit. The small increases are still coming off historic lows and part of the losses reflects net charge-offs from home builders which were approximately $107 million, an increase of $90 million from the fourth quarter. Criticized exposure excluding available for sale and fair value loans increased $5.2 billion from year end partially driven by commercial real estate, again principally home builders. Non-real estate criticized loan and derivative exposure increased modestly as well. The increase was pretty broad based and rising from very low 2007 levels.   Commercial non performing assets rose $736 million to $3 billion. As we saw last quarter additional commercial NPAs involved commercial real estate, home builders to be specific. Home builder exposure was $14 billion at the end of March from a utilized standpoint at $21 billion including commitments. Forty-nine percent of our home builder outstandings is rated as criticized and although pressured we still believe as we said quarter the portfolio is well collateralized.  Looking again at the total loan book, 90-day performing past due on a managed basis increased eight basis points to 74 basis points while 30-day performing past due increased four basis points. First quarter provision of $6 billion exceeded net charge-offs resulting in the addition of $3.3 billion to the reserve. Approximately 60% of the reserve build was in portfolios directly tied to housing principally home equity and to a lesser extent residential mortgage and the home builder sector of the commercial portfolio.   Small business represented approximately 20% of the build. The remaining 20% of the reserve increase was due to growth in seasoning mainly in the consumer unsecured lending and US consumer card portfolios coupled with some stress from the slower economy.   Okay let me get off credit quality and say a couple of things about net interest income. Compared to fourth quarter on a managed and fully tax equivalent basis net interest income was up $546 million of which core which is excluding trading related represented $47 million. The increase in core NII was due to the positive impact of $450 million from loan growth, deposit growth and a rate environment offset by the absence of a one-time fourth quarter benefit of approximately $300 million from the restructuring of our international aircraft leasing operations and one less day in the quarter of approximately $100 million. The core net interest margin on a managed basis remained flat at 3.67% as the positive impact of wider spreads were offset by the absence of last quarter’s leasing restructuring.   And before I refer you to the bubble charts remember that our year end risk position had become more liability sensitive relative to the third quarter as we felt the forwards at December 31 didn’t reflect the level of weakness that we expected. We noted during January’s earnings call that after year-end as the forwards began to reflect that risk we had already begun to return to a more neutral level through decreasing our receives [inaudible] swap portfolio. As you can see from the bubble chart our interest rate risk position is a little less liability sensitive when compared to year end reflecting those moves.  At this point we feel the additional cuts in the forwards are fairly reflective of our views. As a reminder the estimates of net interest income change in the charts are based off the forward curves to the bases higher at March 31st versus December 31st. We will continue to benefit from curve steepening especially from a short end [ledge] deepening which is what we have experienced over the last several months.   Let me say a few things about capital. Tier 1 capital at the end of March was 7.51% up from 6.87% at the end of the year due to the $12.9 billion capital raise in January. The capital raise benefited our Tier 1 ratio by approximately 100 basis points versus year end levels but lower earnings in the first quarter and a higher level of risk weighted assets reduced that benefit by about 35 basis points. As Ken said we remain committed to working back to our 8% target.   The additional capital increased our preferred dividends from approximately $53 million in the fourth quarter to approximately $190 million in the first quarter but still does not include the series K DRD preferred which starts paying in the third quarter and pays twice a year in the first and third quarters. Consequently going forward you should expect preferred dividends to be approximately $190 million in the second and fourth quarters increasing to $426 million in the first and third quarters.  Our tax rate this quarter excluding the FTE impact was 32.7% which is in the range we expect for the rest of the year. Now going forward into 2008 let me piggyback on what Ken said and reiterate that there is considerable uncertainty about the economic environment. It still remains unclear what ramifications the housing downturn, higher energy costs and the subprime crisis will ultimately have and how long the downturn will persist. But we do feel good about our relative position in our businesses versus the competition. Loan and deposit growth generated by the franchise are still expected to benefit net interest income over the next three quarters along with the steeper curve. Deposits will grow as we continue to benefit from our market leadership and innovation and we expect to grow faster than the market.   If you remember what we told you in January we expect growth in managed core net interest income to be in the high single-digit range on a normalized basis and above that on a reported basis from the addition of LaSalle. That outlook hasn’t changed. We’re still expecting growth in non interest income from our consumer businesses. Now the one major surprise since January was the accelerated deterioration in credit quality, mainly in the home equity portfolio. This will continue as a headwind due to what appears to be further deterioration in housing and its subsequent impact on consumer asset quality. Similarly we would expect to see challenges in the consumer dependent sectors of our commercial portfolios.   Given this scenario we would expect net losses to be at least at the levels we experienced in the first quarter and more than likely increase which would require some additional reserve build dependent on the length and severity of the economic weakness. On the expense side we’re aiming for improved operating efficiency from heavy expense control as well as savings realized from the LaSalle integration. And while our outlook over the next several quarters has been tempered somewhat by the economic and credit quality headwinds we faced in the first quarter we still feel very good about our relative position and absent things getting dramatically worse I think earnings for the remainder of 2008 could show an upward trajectory.   With that let me open it up for questions and we thank you for your attention.  
19049	20080421	1330	5	Your first question comes from Matthew O'Connor - UBS  
19049	20080421	1330	6	The capital ratios are a little bit low or lower than some peers and I can appreciate the liquidity. There’s a couple of moving pieces that could benefit that have been discussed in the paper the last day or so with respect to China construction and the sale of the prime brokers business, just wondered if you could give us an update on where you stand there and then also the potential boost to capital from those transactions?  
19049	20080421	1330	7	Let me start with China construction bank, as we indicated before over time we’ll work with the Chinese to see what the ultimate level where they would be comfortable with us holding and then on what schedule they’d want us to begin monetizing the remaining piece. I’d say we have to do that being ever mindful of what they wish and respect for them. We’ve got a great relationship there and we sure want to keep it that way is the way to think about it. Over time Matt, you’d probably see us increase a little bit before we did anything on the other side remind you that contractually we’ve got a lock-up on our investment until at least the fourth quarter. So right now on that side our focus on the strategic assistance agreement and the relationship.   On the prime brokerage sale, we continue - not comment about any specifics of the activity, but we continue down a path to execute that transaction and we’ll let you know if anything in our plans change.   
19049	20080421	1330	8	And then in terms of the impact of capital, correct me if I’m wrong but as you exercise the options from China construction that would flow through OCI the large gain that you have there and boost capital right?  
19049	20080421	1330	9	Over time but it would - any exercise of options contractually is subjected to a holding period and so just like our original investment didn’t come into OCI until within a year of when the restriction went off, the same would hold true for any increase in our investment.   
19049	20080421	1330	10	And then just switching topics here, Ken when I looked at from the loan growth in the consumer categories especially home equity it continues to be very strong and I know this is probably a good time to be increasing market share with standards a lot tighter and spreads a lot wider, but just conceptually how do you balance the risk reward of aggressively growing so this consumer categories when the macro environment is still so uncertain?  
19049	20080421	1330	11	Well Matt I don’t know if its - its not an over attempt to aggressively grow it, it may be - there may be some issues with others not having liquidity or wanting to pull back in a general sense, but we’ve actually as we’ve said strengthened the standard substantially and turn downs have increased substantially. So it must be a factor of others not being as competitive in the marketplace and us really taking advantage of the fact that we do have liquidity and that spreads are so good and the credit quality is so good.   
19049	20080421	1330	12	Matt I might add if you look at our quarter-to-quarter production we’re probably down about 15% in terms of origination on it so you can see the kind of flows slowing down a little bit because of those restrictions - those tightening of some of the standards and the structures but it’s still gone down considerably from the prior quarter.  
19049	20080421	1330	13	Okay great, thank you very much.  
19049	20080421	1330	14	Your next question comes from Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank  
19049	20080421	1330	15	If you could elaborate more on how the credit quality problems are spreading. Joe I thought you said you might see an increase in consumer dependent commercial portfolios and I wasn’t sure what that meant or if I heard you correct.  
19049	20080421	1330	16	Well first of all on the commercial side is I kind of went through in the speech that obviously the most acute weaknesses are in the home builder sector? The point I was making is as the economy slows and the consumer shows weakness that will have an impact on consumer dependent credits in the commercial portfolio and think of that - the easiest to think about Mike would be retail you know with retail spending slows or falls you’d see weakness on that side. Now we could talk to our customer base and when you look at our statistics across the middle market business across the United States if you compare it to 90 days ago, I think you’re hearing before hand you were hearing more concern about what they’re reading in the paper, now you’re feeling a little more of lower investment activity and things of that nature. So having an impact on them but more from an outlook than it is from actual deterioration of credit performance at this point.  
19049	20080421	1330	17	So of your commercial portfolio how much would you deem consumer dependent in one way or another?  
19049	20080421	1330	18	I think the best thing I could do is refer you to our supplement where you can see the industry breakdown because how much of an individual industry is consumer dependent is probably a little more in the eye of the beholder on that and that would be the best way to look at it. But clearly if you start with home builders and then you look at home building supply type companies and then you go on into retail that’d be kind of the way to think about it.  
19049	20080421	1330	19	Okay and with regard to small business the increase in problems which you highlighted is that more in the problem markets like California and Florida or is it more of a product issue or both?  
19049	20080421	1330	20	Clearly weighted towards the places that have had the most stress being the places home prices are falling the most.   
19049	20080421	1330	21	And the increase in commercial real estate, how much of that is due to LaSalle or is that just kind of a broad franchise issue?  
19049	20080421	1330	22	Most of the LaSalle impact came in in the fourth quarter although as we continue to conform our policies into the Bank of America standards we had some additional migration into the criticized level but for the most part most of LaSalle came in in the fourth quarter.  
19049	20080421	1330	23	And home equity where do the losses end does it ultimately go up to credit card type losses?  
19049	20080421	1330	24	Who can predict the future but I would not think that that would be the case? As I said it wouldn’t surprise us to see that cross in the 200 basis points by the - by mid year and in that 2% to 2.5% range probably for the year but its clearly dependent on future additional home price depreciation and the economic weakening and how the duration of the economic weakness.  
19049	20080421	1330	25	And are you seeing that spread out of the high risk markets like California or Florida?  
19049	20080421	1330	26	Yes, absolutely.  
19049	20080421	1330	27	Okay, so this is just not necessarily only a function of markets with big house price declines?  
19049	20080421	1330	28	Ask your first one again Mike.  
19049	20080421	1330	29	I just want to make clear, I mean the higher risk markets are those with the highest home price declines like Florida and California and to the extent that the home equity problems are spreading beyond those higher risk markets.  
19049	20080421	1330	30	There is some spread but the lion share and we put some information in the supplement to try to give you a lot of details, you can see where what’s driving our losses and our delinquencies by state so you can see and there are not solely those markets but it’s clearly dominated by those markets.   
19049	20080421	1330	31	Mike, some huge percentage of the losses are driven by California and Florida.  
19049	20080421	1330	32	Okay and then you’re NPAs went up but your charge-offs also went up almost a similar amount whereas a lot of other banks are saying charge-offs may increase over time. So it’s more coincident for you that others? So it at least raises a question as to whether you were conservative enough in the past in recognizing the charge-offs or something else is going on here for you versus peer?  
19049	20080421	1330	33	Well I don’t think we reserve, as you would expect me to say, we reserve each quarter based on the information flow that we have so that’s our quarterly process. The actually increases in non performing versus charge-offs, you’ve got to remember the size of our credit card book that generates the lion share of our charge-offs, consumer charge-offs overall doesn’t necessarily - doesn’t flow to a non performing asset. Our home equity book which we reserved more for involved charge-offs jumped - they jumped 171 basis points from the 63, we see stuff moving into non performing out of that book of business as well as the mortgage business which has low charge-offs. So it’s a mix. It all depends on what the mix of the business and what goes into non performing versus your charge-off policies on some paper that goes straight to charge-off with nothing going into NPAs.   
19049	20080421	1330	34	Okay thank you.  
19049	20080421	1330	35	Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley  
19049	20080421	1330	36	On the reserve building could you give us some indication as to how you’re thinking about that going forward, is it just tied to your MPA growth or it there anything else there that we should be considering?  
19049	20080421	1330	37	Our reserving policies are kind of - you have to think of it as commercial versus consumer and on the consumer businesses we generally take the information that we know that exists in the portfolio and extrapolate that forward and reserve a certain number of months, generally think of it as about 12 months, although card is a little bit less than that and that’s pretty standard across the industry and somewhat regulatory driven. And so it’s not based off MPAs. On the commercial side, we have a process that we go through that looks at the criticized levels and increase and the ratings within the criticized levels and those tend to be probably the bigger drivers than MPAs. MPAs are really the culmination at the end of migration through criticized so that’s probably more of a driver for you to think about than MPAs themselves.  
19049	20080421	1330	38	And how’s the criticized doing on a Q on Q basis, is there much difference from what the MPAs are telling you?  
19049	20080421	1330	39	We’ve given you in the supplement the criticized information so you can see the details. The MPAs are driven in large part by the consumer business and whereas on the commercial side it’s driven by less of an increase on the commercial side. So there’s not really a connect point there. A lot of the growth in and as I talked about earlier, a lot of the growth in the criticized and commercial is commercial real estate and in particular home builder focused and that’s why we kind of laid out all that detail for you so you could see it.  
19049	20080421	1330	40	Right, it kind of looks on the home builder side like you might be entering the tail end of that cycle, is that fair to say or not?  
19049	20080421	1330	41	That’s kind of dependent on home prices and you know the companies clearly there are things being considered in the marketplace and some of the congressional discussions going on that would assist the home builders but I think you know the home builders’ recovery will probably track more home price stabilization than anything else.   
19049	20080421	1330	42	Okay, so on leverage and the capital markets business; could you just give us a sense as to how you’re thinking about your leverage at quarter end and how you see that going forward? Are you pretty much done with your deleveraging there or is there more to go?  
19049	20080421	1330	43	Deleverage, you’re speaking to the restructuring?  
19049	20080421	1330	44	Correct.  
19049	20080421	1330	45	Brian’s team is in the midst of I guess is what I’d say, I mean obviously we talked about prime broker sale being a part of that and as I referenced when we talked about capital our asset levels and think of this principally as risk weighted asset levels are a little higher than where we’d like them to be and it’s a very place we’re very much focused on so from a business activity standpoint most of the things have been initiated. From a management of balance sheet and return in to the level of profitability we’ve got a ways to go there.   
19049	20080421	1330	46	Okay but we could see some [inaudible] assets coming down as you do that. And then on the net interest margin side, I realize there’s the core business and there’s the trading business, and then there’s also the opportunity you have to take advantage of the yield curve steepness in particular on the back end of the curve, could we anticipate a little bit more activity in perhaps either the trading side or the swap book to benefit more from the back end of the curve than you’ve been generating to date?  
19049	20080421	1330	47	I think not beyond what we’ve kind of tried to tell you about the projection of net interest income or the outlook on net interest income that I reiterated earlier, that kind of incorporates our full view of - and that was core that I was talking about, of where we are and what we’re thinking about there. The capital market side that had a pretty strong growth over prior quarter was curve dependent but also level dependent based on the comments I made earlier on the asset levels so that one is a little more market sensitive, it’s probably as much short end driven, you know curve driven, as it is long end. The core machine though is incorporated in what we told you and kind of an outlook that we have in the bubble charts.  
19049	20080421	1330	48	Okay thanks.  
19049	20080421	1330	49	Outlook shows sequential improvement or increases and so you’ve just begun to see it in the first quarter.  
19049	20080421	1330	50	Okay thanks.  
19049	20080421	1330	51	Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicholaus  
19049	20080421	1330	52	Joe I just had a quick question, the VISA reversal, have you disclosed the amount of the reversal this quarter on the operating spend side?  
19049	20080421	1330	53	No but I would tell you that it wasn’t too far off of the - of negating the 123-R.  
19049	20080421	1330	54	Okay thank you.  
19049	20080421	1330	55	Your next question comes from Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer  
19049	20080421	1330	56	My first question is just a point of clarification, did you - it looks as if several of your product buckets loan losses are accelerating, so I’m confused or do I hear things right in terms of you’re saying that the loss rates will stay constant or at these levels because by my estimates levels would get significantly higher as losses are accelerating?  
19049	20080421	1330	57	Are you talking about loan losses?  
19049	20080421	1330	58	Yes.  
19049	20080421	1330	59	No, the point that we were making in the prepared remarks was we would see our charge-off levels increasing and obviously by the fact of what we reserved that’s a clear indication of our anticipation that we would see those continue to trend up and that’s what we reserved for.  
19049	20080421	1330	60	Okay and then on the OCI line, can you quantify how much you had to write-down CCB this quarter?  
19049	20080421	1330	61	Yes, the CCB drop was -  
19049	20080421	1330	62	I think it was about $3 billion.  
19049	20080421	1330	63	Yes but I would say that if you - I don’t watch it daily but if you looked stock is back up to about where it was at the end of the year, maybe slightly below so that fluctuates.   
19049	20080421	1330	64	Okay and then my final question is to Ken, what of the policies in Washington are the most reasonable or you believe are the most helpful of some type of best case scenario for you and then from a timing of how it would impact your portfolio, your workout, can you comment on the environment in Washington, the conversations that you’re having just to give us who are not in the inner circle a little more perspective.  
19049	20080421	1330	65	Yes well there are several and I’ll probably forget one or two but one of the things I liked the most - one thing was the raising of the limit on what Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could do. That’s going to help the higher priced markets. And then secondly the - I really liked this tax credit to buy foreclosed homes because that’s very specifically getting at the inventory that would actually help stabilize prices quite a bit. And then generally are in favor of most of the things that are being proposed other than things like having judges being able to change the terms, I don’t like that. But basically I think most of the things are being proposed are pretty well thought out.  
19049	20080421	1330	66	Okay, now soon would any type of implementation is this going to be implemented after the fact so you’d benefit in a 210 scenario? Is there any way to know how immediate these actions can take place?  
19049	20080421	1330	67	Well I hope they would be done quickly and of course would hope they’re done after the fact because that would mean things had improved dramatically but that is a concern that things go on and we get into philosophical arguments and nothing happens or it happens too late and so we’re trying our best to state they should be a sense of urgency here.  
19049	20080421	1330	68	Okay so then when you see - mainly see as from brokerage firms saying that we’re beyond the worst of things; can you comment in terms of the regulators involvement with the housing situation and make any similar type of comments?  
19049	20080421	1330	69	Well in a broad sense and I wouldn’t just talk about regulators or the government I think first it would be too early to strike up the band and sing Happy Days Are Here Again. But from the investment banking standpoint that is the write-offs, I do think we’re in the last innings or the last quarter whatever sports analogy you want to use and then the other - the credit issue is so housing dependent and related and economic and economy related that I think we’re not in the last inning or the last few innings and we’ve got at least the rest of this year to go again as Joe said and we said in our comments that we have very high levels of charge-offs and possible additional reserve builds but not the level of reserve builds that we’ve had for the fourth and first quarters.  
19049	20080421	1330	70	Okay thanks.  
19049	20080421	1330	71	Your next question comes from Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods  
19049	20080421	1330	72	I wanted to focus on the home equity book if possible, how much of the $118 billion are first mortgages versus seconds?  
19049	20080421	1330	73	Let me - I don’t have that stat right in front of me Kevin can you get back to Jefferson.   
19049	20080421	1330	74	Appreciate that and then in the 2007 vintage, we see you had a loss rate of 108 how would that compare against 2006 a year ago, is it the seasoning worse than the ’06 or better than the ’06?  
19049	20080421	1330	75	I don’t have the numbers right in front of me, I don’t have the specifics but I would tell you that its tracking probably a little worse and if you just think about what’s happening in the economic environment because the acute housing declines have occurred during that period and so just by virtue of that factor you’d probably see it tracking higher than the ’06 at that earlier date.   
19049	20080421	1330	76	Okay thanks and could you remind us how quickly or what the refreshed loan to value is and how you get the refreshed numbers and how I guess what calculation do you do arrive at the refreshed, is it a new appraisal or what on the refreshed number?  
19049	20080421	1330	77	First of all we provided in the supplement I think the refreshed numbers on all of the - on home equity as well as mortgage, you’ve got that in the package. The process is an automated process just the way we refresh FICOs, we do it with loan to value ratios or combined loan to value ratios in that - its not a go out and get new reappraisals on every portfolio, its through the appraisal services that you can bounce the whole portfolio off of.  
19049	20080421	1330	78	Okay thanks.  
19049	20080421	1330	79	Your next question comes from Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch  
19049	20080421	1330	80	Two quick questions; first could you potentially give us some perspective on your managed credit card loss outlook for the rest of the year and how you would expect that to trend and the second question would be Ken, you mentioned that you have not changed your dividend philosophy but then went to say in a prolonged recession we’d clearly have to consider the most prudent way to manage our capital which to me sort of implied that there would be some chance of a dividend cut in a prolonged recession. Could you talk about what kinds of things you would think about or look for that would potentially lead to a dividend cut and also in light of that, would you cut the dividend first or raise more capital? Assuming you needed to raise more capital would you go out and raise capital to try to preserve the dividend or would you look to cut dividend before another capital raise?  
19049	20080421	1330	81	On your first question on managed credit card losses we were at 5.19 on the consumer card in the first quarter. We kind of talked about in the past that we saw a range of 5 to 5.5 is kind of the normal operating range but obviously if you go into a recessionary period you could bounce over that. At this point I’d say that we may be over that in a quarter here and it wouldn’t surprise us on an annual basis to bounce above that if this kind of economic condition continues and that’s really where we’re at right now. You can - we reserve between somewhere I’m going to rule of thumb call it about 11 months of that you can see on the supplement package we gave you, we reserved to about 525 if you extrapolate that.   
19049	20080421	1330	82	On the dividend question obviously the key thing that we would look at is just how earnings are being affected and after-tax earnings and after-tax after preferred earnings are related to the dividend itself and I’ll repeat what we see in our forecast and what we see for the economy would not lead us to think that we needed to do anything. But obviously that earnings ratio to just the coverage is a - it would be a big factor. Now the first quarter was a little - somewhat of an anomaly in that you take $3.3 billion of pre-tax earnings and put it in your reserve but its still on the balance sheet and still [inaudible] of capital but our second quarter will be critical quarter for us to see if earnings return to what we think would be going toward more normal levels and we’ll kind of go from there but if - I would say that first we would look at - if we thought we needed more capital we’d look at preferred. We would not look at preferred convertible but then after that if things really got bad then we would look at the dividend.  
19049	20080421	1330	83	And I might add that we clearly are focused on asset levels and the [outlaid] assets on the capital market side too.  
19049	20080421	1330	84	We’ve got some hard work to do this quarter on asset levels and C mass.  
19049	20080421	1330	85	Just so I could reiterate that you would look to issue preferred before you would probably cut the dividend if things got bad or worse?  
19049	20080421	1330	86	I think - I was just thinking in general terms but if things got noticeably worse then - and our view of things was that they would continue to be worse for some period of time, a prolonged recession then of course we’d look at the dividend.   
19049	20080421	1330	87	Okay thank you.  
19049	20080421	1330	88	Your final question comes from Nancy Bush - NAB Research  
19049	20080421	1330	89	This would just sort of be a follow on Ed’s question I guess, the Boston Fed President Rosenberg was quoted in the Boston Globe a couple of days ago saying that the Fed was actively encouraging banks to look at raising capital and part of that being of course the dividend cuts which seems to be a bit more active a stance on the part of the Fed than we’ve seen in a while. Can you just comment on this Ken, have you had that conversation with them and are they sort of making the rounds and saying nothing is off the table here? What’s going on?  
19049	20080421	1330	90	I know that in general there’s a - that general feeling that a bank should be looking to cut their dividends if there are capital issues, and I know the Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson has said the same thing but I don’t know exactly who they’re referring to because we would remind everybody that their definition of well capitalized is 6% and so they must be talking about ones that are actually pushing toward that lower end and I think that generally as we talk about they do look a little more holistically and do look at loan loss reserve builds and look at liquidity levels and look at [sheer] levels of equity in addition to just the Tier 1. I think our, I’m not sure I have not researched this, but I think our level of equity capital is the largest base of equity capital of any financial institution in the world and to me that means a little something.   
19049	20080421	1330	91	I would also just add on to that and this may be more of a question for Joe, has the loan loss reserve methodology, not just the number but the methodology changed dramatically versus a year ago. Because it was also heard that the regulators have now been urging more of a prospective look in building the reserve and the SEC and the GAAP issue has at least temporarily gone away. Can you comment on that?  
19049	20080421	1330	92	No Nancy it hasn’t changed. Our methodology hasn’t changed. What sometimes gets blurred with a change in methodology that could be leading to some of the discussion that you have is when you get such volatility in your outlook, what you should consider and you shouldn’t is a harder question than when you’re just kind of straight lined in the less volatile period - when you just don’t have that level and that’s where the grey area begins to come in. So I think it’s not a methodology change its just you’re in a more volatile outlooks and how you consider all of those various factors is where the grey matter is a little bit.  
19049	20080421	1330	93	Thank you.  
19049	20080421	1330	94	That was our final question so I’ll turn this call back to our speakers for any closing remarks.   
19049	20080421	1330	95	Thank you everyone for your participation and have a good day. </TAG>    
24937	20080423	2100	1	Good day, everyone and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter 2008 quarterly results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.   
24937	20080423	2100	2	Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and he’ll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.   Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.   For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.  Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.   And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.   
24937	20080423	2100	3	Thank you, Nancy and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the March quarter was $7.51 billion, an increase of more than $2.2 billion over the previous March quarter’s revenue of $5.26 billion. The tremendous growth in the quarter was driven by very strong demand for Macs, higher revenue from iPod and iTunes and the continued popularity of the iPhone.   Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 17.5%, primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.05 billion, which was up 36% over the prior March quarter’s results and translated to earnings per share of $1.16.   Before going through the details of the March quarter, I would like to give you a few data points indicating just how exceptionally well Apple performed. Revenue growth in the March quarter accelerated to 43% year over year, which is more than twice the 21% growth rate we achieved in the March quarter last year.   We saw healthy growth in all regions, with the U.S. sales growing 40% and international sales growing 47%.   Sales in our 208 retail stores, most of which are in the U.S., were extremely strong, growing 74% year over year, driven in part by traffic of 33.7 million visitors, up 57% from the year-ago quarter.   In the retail stores, 50% of the CPUs we sold were to customers who were new to the Mac, adding growth to our platform.   And finally, our U.S. education business generated Mac unit growth of 35% year over year, its highest growth rate in any quarter in the last eight years.   I would now like to talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 59% of total quarterly revenue. We are extremely pleased to have shipped 2.29 million Macs, just shy of the record number of Macs we sold this past holiday quarter and representing 51% growth over the prior March quarter’s results.   This is a 3.5 times the overall PC market rate of growth for the March quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC, up from the 2 to 3 times market growth rate we have been reporting almost every quarter for the last three years.   Sales of desktops grew 37%, driven by strong demand for the iMac, as well as increased sales of Mac Pro, which we updated in January.   Sales of portables grew 61%, driven by continued strong demand for Macbook and Macbook Pros, both of which were refreshed during the quarter, as well as the successful launch of the Macbook Air. Macbook Air represents a new portable category for Apple and customers have responded very well to its breakthrough design and ultra portability.   We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.   Now I would like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.6 million iPods, an increase of 1% from the year-ago quarter, and we experienced about the same seasonal rate of decline between the December and March quarters as we did last year.   iPod revenue grew 8% year over year from higher ASPs in every geographic segment due to the success of the iPod Touch. We continue to be very pleased with customer response to the iPod Touch and believe the introduction of the software development kit in late June will broaden this appeal even further as great new applications are developed.   After declining 17% year over year in the December quarter, Shuffle sales were also down significantly in the March quarter but the weekly rate of sales improved considerably following the February 19th price reduction.   We continue to achieve our objectives of maintaining our high MP3 market share in the U.S. and gaining share internationally. Our share of the U.S. MP3 market was 73% according to the latest data published by NPD. Outside the U.S., we gained share in nearly every market we have data for based on the latest information from GFK and BCN.   We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.   Sales from iTunes were very strong in the quarter and NPD reported that we have surpassed Wal-Mart to become the largest music retailer in the U.S. The iTunes store has over 50 million customers and over 85% share of the U.S. market for legally purchased and downloaded music based on the latest information from Nielsen Soundscan.   Our movie rental service has been well-received by customers and we have also just begun selling TV shows in Germany and will continue to expand video content internationally.   We are very pleased with iPhone momentum and customer feedback continues to be outstanding. We remain confident in achieving our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008.   We sold 1.7 million iPhones during the March quarter and expanded our sales presence to include Austria and Ireland. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhone, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was $378 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was $1.93 billion at the end of the March quarter, compared to $1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter.   Developer response to the iPhone 2.0 beta software we announced on March 6th has been tremendous. Over 200,000 developers have signed up and downloaded the software development kit. Interest in the iPhone enterprise beta program has also been off the charts. We have received applications from over one-third of the Fortune 500 and over 400 higher ed institutions. Hundreds of companies and institutions have been accepted into the program and more are being added each week.   Because we announced the specific new features to be included in the iPhone 2.0 release and plan to provide them to iPhone customers as a free upgrade in late June, we will delay the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after our March 6th announcement date until the iPhone 2.0 software is delivered.   The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition of handsets sold prior to March 6th and payments from carries has not changed as a result of our announcements.   I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores which had another terrific quarter with revenue growing 74% year over year to $1.45 billion. The stores sold 458,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 67% year over year. We opened four stores during the quarter to end with 208. With an average of 205 stores opened during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million, compared to $4.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 48%.   Operating profit doubled year over year to $334 million from $164 million. A primary objective in our stores has been helping people to get more out of their Macs and the stores delivered 580,000 one-hour personal training sessions during the quarter.  We opened our 15th store in the United Kingdom during the March quarter and we looked forward to opening our first stores in Australia, China, and Switzerland in the coming months. We expect to open about 45 stores during fiscal 2008 and continue to be very confident in the investments we are making in the stores and the asset we are building.   Total company gross margin was 32.9%, which was a little stronger than our guidance due to a more favorable commodity environment, higher overall revenue, and a weaker dollar.   Operating expenses were $1.16 billion, including $112 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $162 million, below our guidance due to the lower interest rate environment.   The tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, below the expected 32% due to higher foreign earnings and lower interest income. We expect the tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2008 to be 31%.   We generated $1 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $19.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2008, we generated $4 billion in cash from $2.6 billion in net income, the difference being driven largely by the iPhone and strong working capital management.   Looking ahead to the June quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.   For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.2 billion, or approximately 33% growth over the prior June quarter. We expect the total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $135 million.   We expect gross margin to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $20 million related to stock-based compensation expense.   We expect OpEx to be about $1.185 billion, including about $115 million related to stock-based compensation expense.   We expect OI&E to decline to about $115 million due to the impact of recent interest rate cuts, and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%.   We expect to generate EPS of about $1.00.   In closing, we are extremely proud of our growth and business performance in the March quarter. Our 51% Mac sales increase is the strongest quarterly growth rate we’ve generated in almost two decades and 3.5 times the market rate of growth. We are very excited about the delivery of the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and the vast potential for compelling solutions that our SDK opens up for the developer community.   We remain very confident in our business and continue to be excited about the new products in our pipeline.   With that, I would like to open the call to questions.  
24937	20080423	2100	4	(Operator Instructions)  Our first question will come from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers.   
24937	20080423	2100	5	Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. Nice revenue and performance. I wanted to ask you a little bit about gross margin. You know, 32.9 was really good but I was wondering if you had thought actually more could flow to the bottom line and what maybe some of the negative cross-currents were. And then also, what gives you the confidence of 33% the next quarter? Just a little bit more on that would be helpful, thanks, and then I just have a follow-up on iPhone.   
24937	20080423	2100	6	Ben, maybe I’ll let Tim make a few comments about the commodity environment and then let me talk more broadly about gross margin in the March quarter and what we expect in June.   
24937	20080423	2100	7	Ben, commodity pricing in both DRAM and the NAND Flash markets hit historically low levels during the March quarter and we would expect that pricing in the current quarter to remain favorable, and we folded that into our guidance.   We believe that the LCD markets near a supply/demand balance and we’ll have relatively stable pricing.   Hard drives, optical drives and most other commodities are in a supply/demand balance and we would expect these commodities to follow historical pricing trends.   
24937	20080423	2100	8	And in terms of the quarter, did anything go against you though that was unexpected in the gross margin line, or was there an impact from the lower price of the shuffles that maybe some of us didn’t anticipate?   
24937	20080423	2100	9	Let me continue on and I’ll address that and talk a little bit about the June quarter as well. As we commented in last quarter’s call, we expected gross margin to decline by about 2.7%. We actually exceeded our guidance this quarter by 90 basis points and the gross margin only reduced by 1.8%.   And the better-than-expected results were primarily due to the favorable commodity environment that Tim discussed, higher revenue in the quarter, and a weaker dollar. The sequential declines in Q1 was primarily due to Leopard entering its second quarter of sales, and as we mentioned on last quarter’s call and as we have seen in the past, a new OS has significantly more sales in its debut quarter. And the change in Leopard and the other Apple software sequentially accounted for over 80% of the gross margin decline that we saw, as we expected.   Other factors affecting gross margin in the quarter were the Shuffle price change; we took several international price reductions as a result of a changing currency market; a higher mix of iTunes, which has lower gross margin; and a sequential decline in the revenues from the holiday quarter, again which were expected.   These factors were somewhat offset by favorable component pricing, allowing us to achieve a gross margin of 32.9%, again which was ahead of our guidance of 32.   
24937	20080423	2100	10	That was pretty detailed. That’s good. In terms of the iPhone, just really switching up and then I’ll cede the floor here, with regard to the iPhone we’ve all noticed less availability, especially as we got towards the end of the quarter and recently. Is there anything -- and then we are widely expecting new products, but is there anything you can say that will give us confidence that you can grow that segment sequentially given the current amount of supply out there? Is there anything you are worried about and what not on the iPhone side in terms of shortages or anything? Or should we assume that you have a handle on that and can grow that business sequentially?  
24937	20080423	2100	11	We are confident on hitting the 10 million for the year. I think that would be the main point.   In terms of the shortages that you referenced, we expected iPhone to decline more on a sequential basis than it did, so we really beat our unit expectations and as a result, as we got toward the end of the quarter we started to experience some stock out.   At this point, both inventory in our stores and our channel inventories are currently low. Our U.S. stores have experienced more stock outs, or relatively more, and we believe the reason is that there are more phones being bought there with the intention of unlocking, which remains a significant number.   
24937	20080423	2100	12	Okay, and you don’t want to clarify that number this time?  
24937	20080423	2100	13	I can’t clarify it. It’s not that I don’t want to; it’s that it is very difficult to come up with a very precise estimate of it, but we do believe the number continues to be significant and our view continues to be that this is a proxy for the worldwide demand of the phone, and our focus is very much on rolling out to more geos and we are on target to roll out into more countries in Europe and to enter Asia later in the year.   
24937	20080423	2100	14	Great, thanks so much, guys.   
24937	20080423	2100	15	We’ll move to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.  
24937	20080423	2100	16	I wanted to ask a couple of channel questions, if I could. Could you guys give some more color on the direct versus indirect mix? And then also, could you give us any update on where you are with the expansion of the Best Buy footprint?  
24937	20080423	2100	17	Bill, the direct sales in the quarter were 53% and that was up from 49 in the year-ago quarter.   
24937	20080423	2100	18	And in terms of Best Buy, we ended with a little over 400 stores, which was to our plan, and we continue to target to be at 600 in the summer. The rollout is going extremely well and we are very, very happy with it.   
24937	20080423	2100	19	And then a follow-up on education, if I could; with education, can you delineate between student buy programs and institutional buying and education, what you experienced this quarter and what you experienced for the upcoming quarter?  
24937	20080423	2100	20	The numbers that Peter quoted in the preamble, we were up 35% and both institutional and individual buying was relatively strong. The quarter that we are now in is a big K-12 quarter and of course back to school is more of a higher education quarter. I wouldn’t want to predict exact numbers but as Peter had mentioned, the 35% is the highest growth rate we’ve seen in ED in eight years.   And we recently learned that we surpassed Dell last year in the portables market share for higher education, so we have significant momentum in this area.   
24937	20080423	2100	21	And there has been a lot of chatter about state and local government spending. Are you guys happy with the institutional part of the education business?  
24937	20080423	2100	22	I am always worried about budgets and will continue to worry about budgets but the results that we have seen to date, with a 35% increase year over year, we have not seen any issue today.   
24937	20080423	2100	23	Appreciate it, thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	24	We’ll move on to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital.  
24937	20080423	2100	25	Thanks very much. Can you just qualify a little bit more the reasons for the delay of the start of revenue recognition on the iPhone and what your thinking was there based on the 2.0 release? And also, what kind of impact we should -- how we should think about relaying that into our iPhone numbers?  
24937	20080423	2100	26	We are doing this -- as I said in my prepared remarks -- because we announced specific new features that will be included in the iPhone 2.0 software that we plan to provide for customers for free who purchased after our announcement on March 6th. So we will delay revenue recognition on phones sold between March 6th and the date of the delivery of the software.   Once we deliver the software, we will resume recognition, revenue recognition of the phones on what we sold between March 6th and that date and begin to recognize, as we had in the past, iPhone revenue on a go-forward basis. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers.   
24937	20080423	2100	27	Okay, so really what we are looking at is just the exclusion of hardware revenue next quarter, really from iPhone?  
24937	20080423	2100	28	Until the software is delivered.   
24937	20080423	2100	29	Okay and just on the iPhone with regard to your 10 million guidance, can you talk a little bit about how important either 3G might be to that or how important at least the timing of some of your pending products that you are referring to in your press release and on your excitement around the iPhone kind of weighs into that 10 million, based on current momentum?  
24937	20080423	2100	30	We don’t comment on new products but I would just reiterate that we are confident with hitting the 10 million and obviously a part of that is rolling out to more geographies and we’ve been working very hard at this and feel confident that we will be able to roll out in more places than Europe and to enter Asia during the year.   
24937	20080423	2100	31	And does that forecast include some now going forward assumption on your part of an unlocked phone percentage?  
24937	20080423	2100	32	The unit number includes phones of all types, locked and unlocked.   
24937	20080423	2100	33	And then final question, you haven’t said anything in your call about economic headwinds. It’s obviously something people are focusing on. It seems you are benefiting from resistance to some of those headwinds and also share gains. Any commentary you can offer in addition to the comments you’ve made that help us understand some of the kind of sustained drivers of that?  
24937	20080423	2100	34	We are going to leave economic commentary to others and we are focused on managing our business, which performed exceptionally well in the March quarter, and I credit it to just outstanding innovative products that drove amazing results.   The U.S. business performed quite well in March. Our revenue grew 40% and this growth rate was twice last year’s March quarter U.S. growth rate of 20 and faster than we grew in the December quarter of 27%.   Mac sales in the U.S. were up 51% and traffic through our stores were up 12 million people year over year and we only have 208 stores. So look, we remain very confident in our business, in our strategy, and we will continue to invest in hardware and software products to delight our customers.   We read the same things that you do but I have provided guidance for the June quarter, which has revenue growing at 33% and again, that is an acceleration from the rate we saw last June by about 10 points.   
24937	20080423	2100	35	Okay, thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	36	We will move to David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.  
24937	20080423	2100	37	Thank you very much. I was wondering, did you give a date on when you are expecting to deliver the 2.0 software for the iPhone? And could you help us understand what impact that has on gross margin, if any?  
24937	20080423	2100	38	David, what we said is we intend to deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and I have included the delay in revenue recognition in the 33% gross margin that I have given you for the quarter. And again, this affects iPhone handset sales only between March 6th and when we deliver the software and it does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers.   
24937	20080423	2100	39	But it is fair to say it does have negative impact on gross margin during that period?  
24937	20080423	2100	40	Well, we will not recognize revenue until we deliver the software, and so that has an impact.   
24937	20080423	2100	41	And then just on your target for the June quarter, you have revenue down I think 4% quarter over quarter, and typically it is up. Is there any particular area that you expect to be sub-seasonal in the next quarter?  
24937	20080423	2100	42	Well, let me talk a little bit about it. We are guiding to $7.2 billion, which again is a 33% increase from the year-ago quarter and is an acceleration of about 10 points from what we saw last June where we grew 24%.   We factored several things into our thinking. First, our Mac channel inventory this past quarter did increase by about 60,000 in the March quarter, as a result of the Macbook Air launch and accelerated sales velocity.   Second, we will not begin recognition of new iPhone sales until we deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June, as I’ve discussed.   Third, we expect a sequential decrease in iPod sales, as we have seen in the last couple of years, so nothing new there.   And fourth, we will see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle and some international price reductions that we took in February.   So that’s what went into our thinking but again, I couldn’t be happier with the performance of the business. I think the guidance we are giving is very strong and would just end by saying again, it’s a growth rate that is faster than what we saw in the year-ago quarter.   
24937	20080423	2100	43	Thank you very much.   
24937	20080423	2100	44	We will move to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.  
24937	20080423	2100	45	Good afternoon. I want to go back to the margin question because this is the first quarter that both growth and operating margins are down year-on-year since March of ’06. Peter, do you feel that you now need to reinvest some of the margin upside to address the growth opportunities internationally and in some of the new product categories, such that year-on-year declines will be more of the norm going forward? Or was there something specific in the calendar for first quarter that will go away later this year?  
24937	20080423	2100	46	Katy, again when we gave you our guidance in January, we gave guidance for 32% gross margin and we reported 32.9, so we did better than we thought, so our gross margin was better than what we had expected.   We are continuing to come out with new innovative products. It is a competitive world and we are thinking thoughtfully about driving growth both in our top and bottom lines and continuing to gain market share in all three of our product areas.   
24937	20080423	2100	47	And then Peter, just quickly, are you still planning to open about half of the new stores internationally this year?  
24937	20080423	2100	48	I don’t know if it will be quite half but our international store openings will be greater this year than they were last. As of the end of the quarter, we had 208 stores open in total and 27 of those were outside the U.S. And we’ve increased our store opening forecast this year by a little bit to 45 stores for the year.   
24937	20080423	2100	49	Great, thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	50	We’ll move to Richard Gardner with Citigroup.  
24937	20080423	2100	51	Thanks, Peter, and Tim, and everybody, actually. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. I am still struggling to understand the gross margin that you reported in the quarter. I understand that you said that the decline in Leopard sales represented the biggest portion of that but it looked like from the segment data that you reported that Leopard revenue was down about $100 million sequentially perhaps. And so that would be about a point of impact on the gross margin sequentially. And given the price cut you did on Shuffle, it seems like that at most was another point impact on the gross margin. And yet since October we’ve had DRAM and NAND pricing down 60% to 70% or more and panel pricing has been pretty favorable as well.   So I’m just wondering if there was anything about the timing of when you procured the components that went into the systems that you built in Q1 that had an impact on the gross margin. In other words, was a lot of the NAND and DRAM that went into Q1 products procured in the December quarter? And if that’s the case, should we expect to get some benefit as you procure a lot of NAND and DRAM now at much lower prices on the Q2 gross margin? Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	52	Rich, let me -- I’d like to make a couple of comments about some of the first things you said and then Tim can address some of your later points.   Our Leopard revenues in the December quarter as we talked about in January was $170 million, and they were just over $40 million in the March quarter. So together, a little over $210 million in the first half. Leopard is by far the best-selling release in our history.   But the sequential decline in Leopard and also iLife and iWork went into its third quarter, were a bit greater than what you thought, so the impact of sequential gross margin decline therefore was a little bigger.   And you also have to factor in, in addition to the pricing actions that we took, lower sequential revenue, so we had less leverage on fixed costs, and iTunes was a bigger mix of the business this quarter than last, and it has a lower gross margin as well.   So there were a number for factors that played into the gross margin coming down but again, it’s better than what we expected it to be. We guided to 32 and achieved 32.9. Tim.  
24937	20080423	2100	53	I’d just add, Rich, that the component advantages as you said were large during the quarter, and those really offset most of the later points that Peter talked about, which were the Shuffle price cut, the international price cuts that we did to adjust for currency, the higher mix of iTunes sales, and the lower overall revenue and the effect it has on the structure.   And so we did receive significant benefit, particularly in the DRAM and NAND Flash areas.   
24937	20080423	2100	54	And if I could follow-up, Tim, with one other question; you mentioned that you said that you thought that memory pricing would continue to be very favorable in the June quarter and yet in the case of both DRAM and NAND, we’re at very, very low levels and in many cases for many suppliers, close to cash costs. What gives you confidence that the pricing will continue to be favorable here as we go into the second quarter and you and other companies start to procure more DRAM and NAND for typical seasonal build?  
24937	20080423	2100	55	To be specific here, favorable does not mean that it goes lower than where it was in March. It means that we envision it trading in a fairly narrow trading range and therefore not increasing that much as we head into the quarter. But I don’t believe that it will go lower because as you say, many people are already charging -- certainly not absorbing all of their fixed cost in the current prices.   
24937	20080423	2100	56	Okay. Thank you.  
24937	20080423	2100	57	We’ll move to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.  
24937	20080423	2100	58	Just a couple of quick things; one, on OI&E, is there anything aside from lower interest rates, given your cash flows, leading to a lower number? Two, can you give us a sense about what the delay in the iPhone recognition meant to the current quarter? Three, the tax rate, can you clarify whether it was down this quarter and this 31%, do we use that going forward? And last, just in terms of as you look at the consumer, obviously you had great numbers but are you seeing any impact on the consumer, are you taking steps to address that -- can you just talk about consumer behavior in general?  
24937	20080423	2100	59	I may not get all of your questions so if I forget one, remind me and I’ll certainly come back to it. I’m going to actually just probably go in reverse order.   In terms of the consumer, we had a very good December quarter and we had an amazing March quarter and I in my prepared remarks wanted to go through some things that I thought would be helpful to you, and I think in a prior question I did, but I’ll go back through just a couple of them.   Particularly in the U.S., our revenues in the United States grew 40% year over year; Mac shipments were up 51% in the U.S., basically at the level we saw around the world; and we saw about 34 million people in our 208 retail stores, most of which were in the U.S.   So our business performed exceptionally well in the March quarter across each of our customer segments, including our retail stores.   In terms of the tax rate, we had been forecasting 32% for the year. With a higher mix of foreign earnings that we saw in the March quarter and lower interest income really as a result of the rate environment, our tax rate for the year looks to be 31%, and so that’s what we are forecasting for the June quarter and for the September quarter. And so in order to get the 31% for the year, we had an adjustment in the March quarter and that is why the tax rate was 29%.   And then I know that you had an OI&E question which I am going to let Gary answer, but was there one other before I turn it over to Gary?  
24937	20080423	2100	60	Just the impact of the iPhone recognition in the current quarter, is there some way to quantify what that was?  
24937	20080423	2100	61	Well, you’ll have to make your estimates but we sold 1.7 million phones during the quarter. We made the announcement on March 6th. You know what we sell the phones for and we recognize the revenue over 24 months. Gary.   
24937	20080423	2100	62	Just to clarify then, the number that you sold, that is still in the -- I just want to make sure I understand it. So that of the -- after March 6th, if you sold, you still counted them as shipments; you just don’t show the revenue is what you are saying?  
24937	20080423	2100	63	Correct.   
24937	20080423	2100	64	And Gary, just on the OI&E?   
24937	20080423	2100	65	I think you asked if there was anything else in the OI&E besides lower effective yields, and the answer is no. We are basically investing in a very short dated, high quality, highly liquid instruments and as consequence, the yield on our portfolio has dropped a little bit, 4.9% a quarter ago. We exited the last quarter -- we were earning about 3.9% and we expect it to go down a little bit more. And there wasn’t any material write-offs in the portfolio. In regard to investments and auction rate securities and asset-backed securities, we don’t have any of those.   
24937	20080423	2100	66	Any further thoughts on cash use, what you are going to do with all that cash?  
24937	20080423	2100	67	No change to announce to you today.   
24937	20080423	2100	68	Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	69	We’ll move to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.  
24937	20080423	2100	70	Good afternoon. Hopefully one last question on the iPhone and the March 6th date; so you obviously recognize -- do not recognize the revenue after March 6th but you would recognize the costs and the expenses related to that, is that correct?  
24937	20080423	2100	71	No, Gene. We will delay recognition of both the revenue and the product costs on the iPhone beginning on March 6th until we release the software, but we will continue to expense our operating expenses around selling and advertising and engineering as period costs as we always have.   
24937	20080423	2100	72	Okay and then second is will you be charging for the upgrade for those who bought iPhones before March 6th for the version 2.0?  
24937	20080423	2100	73	No, as I said in my prepared remarks, we will be providing that software to the then current iPhone customers for free.   
24937	20080423	2100	74	Okay. So then why if everybody is going to get it for free, why are you deferring after March 6th?  
24937	20080423	2100	75	Because the customers that purchased the phone on or after March 6th presumably were aware of the software that we told them that we were going to come out with and that they were going to get it for free, and as a result of our announcement the way you properly account for that is to defer the revenue and that is what we are going to do.   
24937	20080423	2100	76	And just lastly as far as the inventory in the U.S. Apple stores throughout this quarter, should we assume that it will start to creep back up throughout the quarter, or should we just kind of assume it’s going to be sporadic availability throughout the quarter?  
24937	20080423	2100	77	We are shipping product every day, Gene, but I am not going to forecast the exact in-stock levels of the stores. But we’ve factored in our current thinking of supply/demand into the guidance.   
24937	20080423	2100	78	Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	79	We’ll move to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.  
24937	20080423	2100	80	A couple of questions; the first, can you talk a little bit about what we are seeing with the pricing at some of your European carrier partners with regard to the iPhone? Who bears the cost on this? Is this something carrier driven? Any commentary you can make on that?  
24937	20080423	2100	81	The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldn’t comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential.   
24937	20080423	2100	82	Okay, and any thoughts on maintaining a 2.5G iPhone once the 3G is out?  
24937	20080423	2100	83	We don’t comment on new products, sorry.   
24937	20080423	2100	84	Okay, thought I would try. You know, we’ve got to try sometimes. Anyway, final question though is on the channel, because obviously your Mac sales were quite strong. Can you talk a little bit about where you are seeing the strength in the channel? Obviously you are expanding a bit more on your stores but from a CES standpoint or consumer electronics versus direct?  And then also just any comment you can make about linearity during the quarter? Thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	85	First of all, we are seeing strength in all geographies. It has been amazing at how balance it has been. If you look at the Mac, in the Americas we were up 52% year over year; in Europe, we were up 48%; in Japan, we were up 47%; and so it is very solid throughout. In Asia-Pacific we were actually up 62. And so these are obviously all multiples to the market growth.   Within each of those, the consumer appears to be very strong. Our pro business also had a very nice pick-up last quarter. The Mac Pro sold more units since it debuted with the new Intel processor. Education was up 35% in the U.S. And so overall, just strength everywhere. We felt very good.   
24937	20080423	2100	86	Okay, and then linearity during the quarter for both iPhones as well as Macs?  
24937	20080423	2100	87	On the Mac side the only unusual thing in the linearity side was we started shipping the Macbook Air late in January. It was constrained most of the quarter and so a lot of those shipments did go out in the month of March.   By the end of March, we were at near a supply/demand balance on it.   
24937	20080423	2100	88	Okay, and then just one final question -- well, actually, linearity on iPhone and then --   
24937	20080423	2100	89	iPhone again, we really outstripped our supply toward the end of the quarter because we sold more than we had expected. We thought there would be a -- more of a sequential decline there than there was. It was reasonably strong throughout but March in particular was strong.   
24937	20080423	2100	90	Okay, great. And then just any indication you can give us with regard to Macbook Air on gross margins above or below -- I don’t know, anything you’d give us as a metric?  
24937	20080423	2100	91	The customers love it.   
24937	20080423	2100	92	So no comment on gross margins? Okay. Thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	93	Not at the individual unit level.   
24937	20080423	2100	94	Okay. Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	95	We’ll move to our next question; Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.   
24937	20080423	2100	96	Peter, when you in fact ship the SDK, is there a catch-up period for the phones that were shipped or is it all ratably from that point?  
24937	20080423	2100	97	If I understand your question, Keith, we will begin to recognize the revenue and the product cost once we ship the 2.0 software over the remaining lives of the -- remaining lives for the phone.   
24937	20080423	2100	98	So there is no catch-up period, it will be ratably from that point?  
24937	20080423	2100	99	Ratably, yes, over the remaining life.   
24937	20080423	2100	100	Fair enough. Okay, and then Peter, I want to go to the gross margin side. When I look at the year-over-year comps, gross margins were down about 220 basis points. You flagged some areas that were different on the sequential basis. Leopard would be out of the equation; in fact, software was a richer mix when you look at March to March. Could you just pick out a couple of the other large drivers of change on a year-over-year basis? And particularly if you could identify whether the mix between CPUs and iPods was favorable or unfavorable.   
24937	20080423	2100	101	Keith, it is really hard for me to do year-over-year gross margin comparisons because you’ve got your different points and your product cycles, different commodity cycles, different mix. And that’s why we’ve traditionally talked about gross margin on a sequential detail and I would prefer to just stick with the sequential comments that I gave you, which again gross margin was better than what we thought it would be.   
24937	20080423	2100	102	Fair enough. Then last question for me then, Peter, if you -- you have your operating segments and if you thought about is there a deviation in the operating segments and the amount of gross margin they report by geography? In other words, was the variance in terms of the individual geographies materially different than what you had as a company as a whole?  
24937	20080423	2100	103	We’ll put out the 10-Q in the next week or so and our segment reporting at the gross margin level will be there. You can look at prior 10-Qs to see the different gross margins in the segments. And there’s a little bit of variability but we are quite happy with each of our segments.   
24937	20080423	2100	104	Okay, I’ll cede the floor. Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	105	We’ll move to Shaw Wu with American Technology.   
24937	20080423	2100	106	I just had a question on your acquisition of PA Semi -- any comments or color you can give around that? Thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	107	Shaw, we occasionally buy smaller technology companies from time to time and we don’t have a practice of commenting on our purpose or plan, so I can’t.   
24937	20080423	2100	108	Okay, thanks.   
24937	20080423	2100	109	We have Jeff Fidacaro from Merrill Lynch.  
24937	20080423	2100	110	Peter, I was wondering if you could touch on the Mac side. When you take a look at PC unit growth, typically it’s down quarter over quarter in the calendar second quarter. Given your strength has accelerated to about three times the market growth, I wonder if you could highlight any comparable seasonality in the Mac business in your June quarter.   
24937	20080423	2100	111	What we generally see in June is a sequential increase in Mac shipments as the education buying season begins and the June quarter tends to be more heavily weighted to K-12, which buys typically at lower ASPs, and the September quarter tends to be more heavily weighted within the ED buying season by higher education.   
24937	20080423	2100	112	And just one follow-up; if I move over to the iPhone, when you look at the unlocked or non-activated phones in the prior quarter, some of that was gifts that were bought late in the holiday season. Have you seen any change in behavior from the carryover from that December quarter? Were they actually activated? Have you seen any significant changes?  
24937	20080423	2100	113	As Tim commented, it’s really hard to estimate precisely and we don’t want to throw a number out. Unlocking is occurring and it is significant but our view is that this is -- it’s just a clear interest in demand globally for the iPhone and we think it -- we are hearing reports of iPhones being used in many countries and this is one of the things that gives us confidence in our goal of shipping 10 million in calendar 2008.   
24937	20080423	2100	114	Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	115	We’ll move to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.  
24937	20080423	2100	116	Thank you. I was hoping you could reconcile your statement that iPhone demand was outstripping supply at the end of the quarter with what appears to be an excess supply in most European countries of the phone. You indicated that they can price as they want and we are seeing price cuts of over 50% on the phone, which certainly doesn’t sound like a situation where they are under-supplied.   Were you seeing a noticeably different demand profile in the U.S. relative to your expectations versus Europe? And if so, why couldn’t you simply ship phones from what appears to be an overstocked Europe to the U.S. to fulfill that demand?  
24937	20080423	2100	117	Tony, my point was that stock-outs were occurring in our own stores toward the end of the quarter and we believe that was because our stores are more susceptible to people going in and buying multiple units and then unlocking and exporting them.   However, I also added that currently inventories are low in both our stores and in the channel.   
24937	20080423	2100	118	And is that also the case in your European channel or is that an aggregate channel statement?  
24937	20080423	2100	119	I don’t want to be specific at the carrier level but I the aggregate, Europe is low. In the aggregate, the U.S. is low.   
24937	20080423	2100	120	And at the very end of the quarter where you were having stock-outs in your own stores, was your channel inventory also low? Because it seemed like the phones were readily available in Europe and through AT&T stores, which obviously beg the question of why were you not able to better balance the allocation of phones, particularly towards the end of the quarter?  
24937	20080423	2100	121	Once the units are already shipped and designated to a carrier, the ability to move them from carrier to carrier is very low. And so you can have very short-term cases where there is some imbalance. But I think the major point is that we sold more than we thought we would and that today, inventories are low and in aggregate in Europe and in aggregate in the U.S.   
24937	20080423	2100	122	Can you comment on whether you thought you sold more in Europe than you thought you would?  
24937	20080423	2100	123	No, I’m just going to comment that in total, that we sold more than we expected. We expected a sharper seasonal decline than what we experienced and as you know, this was our first Q1 to Q2 that we’ve been in the phone business, and so we’ve learned something.   
24937	20080423	2100	124	And then staying with the phone, I know a couple of other people have asked but last quarter on this call, you said you weren’t comfortable discussing the unlocked percentage because of the high concentration of phones that had been sold at the very end of December and the holiday season and that you felt you’d get a better read on that in January. Invariably you have gotten a better read on that, and so given that you had given out the number before, or an estimate of that number, why the reticence now give at least for last quarter you should have ample ability to be able to quantify that?  
24937	20080423	2100	125	We don’t feel that we can quantify it with precision, and so we don’t want to put out a number that we can’t stand behind. But we’ve gone out of our way to classify the number as significant. I’m not sure how to be more clear than that.   
24937	20080423	2100	126	And then switching to Macs, your notebook ASP declined sequentially and year over year, given that you introduced the Macbook Pro which sounded like got off to a good start, and you also mentioned strength in Macbook pros. Were those both relatively small and were price cuts relatively big? Or how do we reconcile the ASP decline?  
24937	20080423	2100	127	The ASP decline was slight, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis and they were largely driven by the transition that we had in the quarter and some mix shifts within our Macbook and Macbook Pro lines. But again, they were small.   
24937	20080423	2100	128	Okay. Thank you very much.   
24937	20080423	2100	129	We’ll move to Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.  
24937	20080423	2100	130	I have a couple of questions; one is do you have any color that you can provide on the demographics of Macbook Air purchases? You know, I originally thought it would be for road warriors but the numbers suggest it is selling far better than that.   And sort of in the same vein, do you have any sense of how many Window users purchased a Macbook Air?  
24937	20080423	2100	131	We don’t on the latter, Charlie. What we would share is that it is appealing to all sorts of people, from college professors to students to people that travel a lot. It seems to have universal appeal and also the cannibalization factor was extremely low to the other portables, which is one of the key reasons we were able to have a very minor sequential decline from Q1, where usually it would be much deeper.   
24937	20080423	2100	132	Thank you.   
24937	20080423	2100	133	Thanks, Charlie and thanks to everyone for joining us.

139677	20080415	1230	1	Good morning and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.   
139677	20080415	1230	2	Good morning and welcome. I’m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2008. With me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.   A few logistics before we get into the details -- this review is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Included with the copy of the press release that was sent to the investment community earlier this morning is the schedule showing sales for major products and/or business franchises to facilitate updating your models. These are also available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release.   I will review highlights of the first quarter 2008 results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following additional remarks from Dominic, we will open the call to your questions. We expect the total call to last approximately one hour.   Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2007 identifies certain factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.   Last item -- during the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available on the Johnson & Johnson website.   Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2008. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let’s begin with the schedule titled supplementary sales data by segment of business.    Worldwide sales to customers were a record $16.2 billion for the first quarter of 2008, up 7.7% as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Our operational growth was 2.6% and currency contributed 5.1 points. If you turn to the schedule showing sales by geographic area, you will see that we achieved growth of 2.8% in the U.S. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.4%, while the effect of currency exchange rates positively impacted our reported results by 11.3 points. Our strongest performing region was the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., growing 6.2% on an operational basis. Asia-Pacific/Africa region grew by 3.2% operationally while Europe grew 0.8% operationally.   If you will now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings on a reported basis were $3.6 billion and earnings per share were $1.26. This compares to $2.6 billion and $0.88 in the same period in 2007. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided adjusted earnings information. As a reference in the footnote, the 2007 results had been adjusted for the after-tax impact of the in-process research and development charge of $807 million associated with the acquisition of Conor Medsystems.   Net earnings on an adjusted basis were up 6.4% and adjusted earnings per share were up 8.6%.  I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to the adjusted earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold at 28.5% is down 60 basis points as compared to the same period in 2007, with reductions seen across all three segments. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses of 31.6% of sales are down 30 basis points as compared to 2007. This leverage is due to reductions primarily in our pharmaceutical business.   Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.6%, 40 basis points less than the first quarter of 2007. Research and development spending is up nearly 4% in the quarter. Interest expense net of interest income of $16 million compares to $33 million of net interest income in the first quarter of 2007. This increase in expense is due to a higher average debt position in the quarter versus the same period last year, as we continue buying back shares as part of our repurchase program.   Other income net of other expense was $18 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $228 million in the same period last year. The 2007 results included the gain related to the divestitures of certain brands in connection with the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare.   With regard to taxes, please direct your attention to the effective tax rate excluding special charges shown in the box section of the schedule. In the first quarter of both 2007 and 2008, taxes were 24.2%.   Turning now to business highlights, I’ll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales of $4.1 billion increased 16.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Operational growth was 9.9% while currency contributed 6.3%. U.S. sales were up 11.7% while international sales grew 8.3% on an operational basis.   For the first quarter of 2008, sales for the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 21% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2007. Sales in the U.S. were up 29% while sales outside the U.S. were up 12% operationally. The successful launch of ZYRTEC in the U.S. in January of this year is the major contributor to this increase. Additionally, both the adult and pediatric analgesics achieved strong growth, driven by an increased uptake in the rapid release gels and the later start to the winter flu season.   Our skin care business achieved operational sales growth of 4% in the first quarter of 2008 with sales in the U.S. growing at 7% and sales outside the U.S. up 2% on an operational basis. Strong growth was driven by Clean and Clear, Aveeno, and Nutrogena, due to a combination of new product launches and strength in the core businesses due to innovative technologies, like Helioplex. These gains were partially offset by the discontinuation of a small line of facial refreshers.   Baby care products achieved operational growth of 11% when compared to the first quarter of 2007. Sales growth in the U.S. was 6% due to increased babycenter.com sales. Sales outside the U.S. grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by the strong double-digit growth of wipes, hair care, powder, and oil.   Women’s health achieved operational growth of 2%. Sales in the U.S. were down 9% due to increased competition, while sales outside the U.S. were up on an operational basis by 9% with strong growth in both the internal and external sanitary protection lines.   Operational sales growth in the oral care franchise was 3% with U.S. sales down 2% and sales outside the U.S. up 9%. Strong growth was achieved for the Listerine product line due to whitening strips launched in the third quarter of 2007 and the strong performance of Listerine mouthwash. Sales declines in Reach toothbrushes and Rembrandt products partially offset this growth.   That completes our review of the consumer segment and I’ll now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment.   Worldwide net sales for the first quarter of $6.4 billion were up 3.3% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales were down 0.6% with positive currency contributing 3.9 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 0.9% while sales outside the U.S. decreased on an operational basis by 3.1%.   Our results continue to be impacted by generic competition on some of our products, namely DURAGESIC, and outside the U.S. RISPERDAL ORAL in many countries. The combined effect of this generic competition has reduced the first quarter worldwide pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 3.5 percentage points with the U.S. impact estimated at approximately 1% and the impact outside the U.S. estimated at nearly 8%.   Additionally, we saw a retraction in the U.S. market for ESAs following the ODAC discussions, the label changes, and changes to reimbursement. The resulting decline in PROCRIT sales impacted the worldwide pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 4 points. Excluding both the impact of generics and declining PROCRIT sales, the underlying operational growth for pharmaceutical products was approximately 7%.   PROCRIT/EPREX had a combined operational decline of 27% with PROCRIT down 37% and EPREX down 9% on an operational basis. New competition and label reviews have contributed to the lower sales results for EPREX.    PROCRIT results have been impacted by a decline in the market versus the first quarter of 2007, estimated at approximately 37%, and partially offset by an increase in overall market share. PROCRIT aggregate share across all markets was approximately 45% in the first quarter of 2008, up one point versus the same period last year. Increased share in the hospital and retail markets was partially offset by lower share in the oncology clinics due to our competitors’ anti-competitive contracting strategies.   RISPERDAL Oral had an operational decline of 9% when compared to the same period  a year ago. Sales in the U.S. grew 4% with market growth of approximately 6% offset by a slight decline in market share. Sales outside the U.S. declined 34% on an operational basis due to generic competition for RISPERDAL Oral in many markets.   ACIPHEX, as it’s known in the U.S. market, and PARIET outside the U.S. is a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were down 23%. U.S. sales were down 27% and sales outside the U.S. were down 19% operationally. In the U.S., market share has been negatively impacted by additional generic launches of competitor PPIs. Similar market dynamics impacted sales outside the U.S., compounded by the impact of market entry in Canada of generic Rabeprazole, the active ingredient in PARIET.   Now moving on to our growth drivers -- REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases, grew by 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2007. Sales growth in the U.S. was 13%. Market growth in the Anti-TNF category continued to be strong and the competitive dynamics intensified with the new competitors in the market and current competitors receiving new indications.   Sales to our customers for markets outside the U.S. more than doubled due to a combination of the timing of shipments, strong market demand, and the positive impact of currency. The timing of shipments reflects inventory planning on our customer’s part and was estimated to contribute approximately two-thirds of the increase in sales outside the U.S. versus the same period last year. We expect the resulting build in inventory levels held by our customer will be reduced over the balance of the year.   Sales of TOPOMAX, which is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis, increased operationally by 4% with similar results both in and outside the U.S. In the U.S., market share in the migraine category increased versus the same period last year; however, market growth was flat. Outside the U.S., strong growth was achieved in many markets, partially offset by generic entries in certain other markets.   Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were up 3% on an operational basis when compared to the same period a year ago. Growth has been tempered by increased competition.   RISPERDAL CONSTA, our long-acting injectable formulation, achieved first quarter sales growth of 10% on an operational basis. U.S. sales growth was flat and was impacted by a reduction in the wholesaler inventory levels. Excluding this impact, growth was estimated to be double-digit. Sales outside the U.S. were up 16% operationally due to a positive shift form oral to injectable therapies.   CONCERTA, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, grew 13% operationally in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. were up 12% with continued strong market growth. Sales outside the U.S. grew 15% on an operational basis with strong growth seen in most regions; however, competitive dynamics continued to intensify.   VELCADE, a treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma, is being co-developed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals. We have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world. Operational sales growth was very strong at 49%, with strong momentum due to the predictable safety profile and a favorable benefit risk ratio.   With the potential acquisition of Millennium by Takeda, our ex-U.S. rights under the collaboration, distribution, and licensing agreement with Millennium concerning VELCADE will not change.   Wrapping up the review of the pharmaceutical segment, last week we submitted to the FDA the manufacturing supplement sNDA for IONSYS and the sNDA for RISPERDAL CONSTA for adjunctive maintenance treatment to delay the occurrence of mood episodes in patients with frequently relapsing bipolar disorder.   I will now review the medical devices and diagnostic segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostic segment sales of $5.7 billion grew 1.4% operationally as compared to the same period in 2007. Currency contributed 5.8 points to the sales growth to bring total growth to 7.2%. Sales in the U.S. grew 0.2% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 2.6%. Results have been impacted by lower sales of drug eluting stents. Sales excluding the impact of lower sales of drug eluting stents grew nearly 5% operationally.   Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 15% operationally with similar results in and outside the U.S. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of Cypher, our Sirolimus-eluting stent, partially offset by the results of our Biosense Webster business and our neurovascular business.   Cypher sales were approximately $400 million, down 27% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $170 million were down 28%. A reduction in PCI procedures, a lower penetration rate of drug eluting stents, and lower prices resulted in an estimated market decline in the U.S. of approximately 25% versus the first quarter of 2007.   Estimated share in the U.S. of 43% was down three points sequentially and down two points from the first quarter of 2007 due to the market entry of a new competitor during the quarter.   Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $230 million declined 27% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 39% was down one point on a sequential basis and down from 52% in the first quarter of 2007. Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S.  CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 41%, down one point sequentially and down 7 points from the first quarter of 2007.   Now, turning to growth drivers within the Cordis franchise, the Biosense Webster business, our electro-physiology business, achieved double-digit operational growth in the quarter with the ultrasound products continuing to be strong contributors. The neurovascular business also achieved strong growth in the quarter due to the relaunch of the TRUFILL DCS Orbit Coil system and the enterprise stent in 2007.    Our Depuy franchise had operational growth of 4% when compared to the same period in 2007, with the U.S. growing 2% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 6% operationally. Hip growth on a worldwide basis was 9% operational, led by the strong results in the U.S. where we hold the number one market position. On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was 2% while spine was flat. Mitech, our sports medicine business, grew 11% operationally.   Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 6% in the first quarter of 2008, with U.S. sales growing 3% and sales outside the U.S. growing on an operational basis by 9%. Strong results were achieve in the energy business due to the success with the harmonic scalpel. In addition, the Endocutter, a key product in performing bariatric procedures and advanced sterilization products also contributed to the growth in the quarter.   Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 1% with U.S. down 1% and sales outside the U.S. growing operationally by 3%. On an operational basis, sales of sutures and women’s health were flat while meshes and hemostasis achieved solid growth. The diabetes franchise grew operationally by 6% in the first quarter of 2008. The U.S. business grew by 4% while sales outside the U.S. grew 8% on an operational basis. Growth in the U.S. was driven by the strong double-digit growth of the Animas pump business. The success of the one-touch ultra line has been the major driver of growth outside the U.S.   Our Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 12% with sales in the U.S. growing at 16% and sales outside the U.S. growing 9% on an operational basis. Growth for the franchise was driven by the global success of Acuvue Oasis, One-Day Acuvue Moist, and Acuvue Advanced for Astigmatism. Additionally, outside the U.S. One-Day Acuvue Define made a strong contribution to growth in the quarter.   Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostic segment, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics achieved operational growth of 4% in the first quarter. Sales outside the U.S. were up 5% on an operational basis due to increased sales in clinical chemistry. Sales growth in the U.S. was 2% with donor screening and immunohematology products achieving double-digit results. Partially offsetting this growth was lower sales in clinical chemistry due to shipment timing.   With the launch of the Chagas assay in 2007, 85% of the U.S. blood supply is now screened for this disease.   That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostic segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2008. Before we open the call to your questions, I’ll turn the discussion over to Dominic Caruso for some additional comments. Dominic.   
139677	20080415	1230	3	Thank you, Louise. We are very pleased today to report solid financial results for the first quarter of 2008, which Louise has already highlighted for you. As we expected, our first quarter results reflected the continued impact of generic competition, the softening of the market for ESAs, some additional competition in drug eluting stents, and the implementation of our cost restructuring program announced last year. Our sales results for the quarter were above the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call.   In the first quarter of this year, we have benefited from the successful launch of ZYRTEC, which included some initial inventory build in the trade, as well as the timing of shipments of REMICADE to our partner for distribution outside the U.S., reflecting inventory planning on their part.  Additionally, in some of our MD&D businesses in the U.S., we saw slower ordering patterns from our distributors, which is due partly to timing of shipments and which may also be an early sign that procedure volumes may have slowed somewhat, at least in the first quarter.   We delivered another solid earnings performance for the quarter as well, which reflects our ability to continue managing our cost and improving our margins. We have largely implemented the cost restructuring program that we announced last year and we remain on track to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion for 2008.   As you can see, our operating margins have improved across each major category of the earnings statement. Our solid earnings performance exceeded the mean of analyst estimates as published by First Call.   Now a brief update on the progress of our $10 billion share repurchase program. As you’ll recall, we began purchasing shares in August of 2007 and to date, we have purchased approximately $5.1 billion of our stock, or approximately 80 million shares. This share repurchase program, along with our dividends, continues to demonstrate our commitment to returning value to our shareowners while maintaining a strong financial position that provides the flexibility to invest in business building activities for future growth.   This quarter we continued to show progress on new product introductions and pipeline developments that will fuel our growth going forward. In consumer, as I mentioned, our allergy treatment ZYRTEC became available without a prescription in stores across the U.S. for the first time. As the number one prescribed allergy treatment in the U.S., ZYRTEC’s availability over the counter has been highly anticipated and its launch has gone very well. Based on the data so far, we’ve reached 90% of U.S. stores in our first three months and we are very encouraged by the response. Our launch plans are on schedule, the marketing campaign is going well and we continue to view ZYRTEC’s switch as an important growth contributor for our consumer business.   Meanwhile, the integration of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business and brands continues to be on track to meet or exceed our target of $500 million to $600 million in cost synergies by 2009, and we still expect this transaction to be break-even or modestly accretive by 2009, one year ahead of the original schedule.   We’ve also seen significant progress in our medical device pipeline this quarter. Our Cordis and Conor Medsystems businesses have begun a randomized clinical trial comparing the [Nevo] Sirolimus-eluting coronary stent to Taxus Liberte Paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. [Nevo] is the brand name for our new Conor Sirolimus product. We look forward to the results of this trial and remain excited by the prospect of combining a Sirolimus drug, which is used in Cordis’ CYPHER drug eluting stent, with Conner Medsystems unique reservoir technology for drug delivery.   At our analyst meeting last October, we also discussed the development of the first computerized personalized sedation system, or CAPS. Ethicon Endo-Surgery has recently submitted a pre-market approval application to the FDA for this system.   Turning to our pharmaceutical pipeline, we received good news on the virology front. The FDA in January granted accelerated approval to Tibotec pharmaceutical’s HIV medicine, INTELENCE, which was previously known as TMC125. This is the first new drug in its class to be approved in 10 years and its accelerated approval is a tribute to the breakthrough research and development that our virology teams have been doing.   Meanwhile, in the area of pain management, we submitted a new drug application to the FDA for tapentadol, an investigational oral analgesic for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain. In addition, Centocor submitted a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe this quarter for the approval of golimumab, or CNTO148. Golimumab is a monthly subcutaneous treatment for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.  As a reminder, we have several new compounds currently under review with health authorities. These include Ustekinumab in the U.S. and the E.U.; paliperidone palmitate in the U.S.; [hipoxitene] in select countries in Europe; and ceftobiprole in the U.S. and the E.U.  I would now like to provide some comments for you to consider as you refine your models for 2008. Let’s start with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. During the first quarter of 2008, the company continued to generate strong cash flows. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $400 million of net debt. This consists of approximately $11 billion of cash and investments and $11.4 billion of debt. This is a slight increase in our overall net debt position from year-end 2007 as we have used approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter of this year to continue buying our stock under our share repurchase program.   For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, and considering the continuation but not full completion of the share repurchase program during 2008, I would suggest you consider modeling net interest income of between zero and a minor level of interest income consistent with our guidance in January.   Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder this account is where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, gains or losses from investments by our development corporation, or asset sales. This account is difficult to forecast but assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2008 as a net gain ranging from approximately $100 million to $150 million, or a somewhat lower level of other non-operating net gains as compared to our earlier guidance.   And now a word on taxes; for the first quarter of 2008, the company’s effective tax rate was 24.2%. We would suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2008 in the range of 24% to 24.5%, which would not include any special items and is consistent with our earlier guidance. Additionally, this guidance does not assume the reenactment of the R&D tax credit for 2008.   As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.   Turning to sales, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth for the full year 2008 of between 1% and 2%, consistent with our earlier guidance.   As you know, currency impacts are difficult to predict and while we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency rates were to stay where they are today through the end of this year, our sales growth would be favorably impacted by approximately 4.5%, resulting in total reported sales growth for the year of between 5.5% and 6.5%.   Now for earnings -- when I last checked, the First Call mean estimate for our EPS for full year 2008 was $4.44 per share. Considering the strength of our first quarter earnings performance, the impact of the launch of ZYRTEC, and the timing of shipments for REMICADE as I mentioned earlier, but not losing sight of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for RISPERDAL in the second half of the year, we suggest that you model our EPS for 2008 excluding any special items between $4.40 and $4.45 per share, slightly higher than our guidance in January.   That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and our guidance with respect to your models. I look forward to updating you throughout the year on our quarterly earnings calls. Thank you and now back to you, Louise.   
139677	20080415	1230	4	Thank you, Dominic. Elizabeth, can you please give the instructions for the questions?  
139677	20080415	1230	5	(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan.   
139677	20080415	1230	6	Good morning. First question, Dominic, you had a strong quarter here particularly with regard to consensus expectations. I think the consensus for the quarter was $1.20. You reported $1.26 adjusted, so you had a $0.06 beat but relative to your prior guidance, you only raised expectations for the year it looks like by $0.01. So maybe you can just comment on that. Thanks.   
139677	20080415	1230	7	Sure, Mike. The -- as I commented on throughout the discussion and Louise did in her discussion as well, we mentioned that we benefited in the first quarter from a number of items, particularly the successful launch of ZYRTEC, which included some inventory stocking in the trade. Of course, that will then bleed off a bit in the remaining quarters of the year.  Our launch plans are consistent with our annual guidance but we did see some significant build in the first quarter and that impacted our first quarter number. I don’t think that the -- when I looked at the various estimates throughout the analyst community, it didn’t seem like those were built in to those estimates.   And secondly, we mentioned that the O-U.S. shipments for REMICADE to our partner were significant in the first quarter, reflecting also inventory build on their part. As you may remember, we shipped bulk to our partner outside the U.S. and they finish the product for distribution outside the U.S. and through their inventory planning process, they ordered much more earlier in the year than perhaps we would have anticipated. So we think that will obviously bleed off as well.   So taking that into consideration, those two items into consideration, and also looking at the fact that we expect a little bit lower non-operating gains, as I mentioned, and other income and expense, we thought it would be prudent to review our annual results again with you and slightly increase our expectations for the year.   
139677	20080415	1230	8	Okay. You made a couple of other interesting comments that look at the performance of the business, as the consumer business was very strong, obviously helped by ZYRTEC but was still strong across the board. And then you made a comment about the really your U.S. MD&D business. You had a number of businesses that decelerated this quarter versus what we had seen last quarter and you made a comment about procedure volumes. Ethicon was surprisingly light this quarter. Ethicon Endo was I think 3% and Life Scan was slower and it was a little bit slower. So the commentary there about the distributor ordering patterns and procedure volumes, can you just flesh that out a little bit in terms of what you think you are seeing across the MD&D business?  
139677	20080415	1230	9	Sure. What we’ve seen early on in the year is that as I mentioned, distributors softened their ordering a little bit in the early part of the year. Our field checks tell us that’s a little bit of an inventory burn on their part, which is okay as you might expect that to happen. But also there may be early -- these are very early signs that at least in the first quarter, we did see some lower procedure volumes across the surgical suites in the U.S. We don’t -- we’re not sure whether that is going to be an impact for the full year or not but we definitely think it had some impact in our first quarter.   
139677	20080415	1230	10	Okay, great. Last question and then I’ll let someone else jump in here --  ceftobiprole  which became approvable later on during the quarter, what is your expectation there for timing?  
139677	20080415	1230	11	Well, the timing is obviously we have to work through with the FDA their completion of the review. You may remember that the reason -- in the approvable letter, the FDA cited completion of site inspections on their part and review of some additional information that we have provided. There’s been no indication of any safety or any other manufacturing issues of any sort, so I don’t want to predict how long it will take the FDA to complete their review and we would just like to wait and make sure that they are thoroughly complete with their review and then get back to us on their findings.   
139677	20080415	1230	12	Great. Thank you, Dominic.   
139677	20080415	1230	13	Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	14	Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Reicin with Morgan Stanley.  
139677	20080415	1230	15	A couple of housekeeping questions -- you brought up the REMICADE stocking issue. You said it’s two-thirds of growth so that comes out to about $125 million. Is that about right?   
139677	20080415	1230	16	Your math is good.   
139677	20080415	1230	17	Okay, and then on ZYRTEC, can you at all quantify what you think the initial stocking was? And then you said it’s going to be a great growth driver for the year. Can you quantify what your expectations are for ZYRTEC for the year?  
139677	20080415	1230	18	We won’t -- Glenn, as you know we won’t give individual estimates for a product growth. ZYRTEC is included in our overall sales growth estimates for the year.   As far as the first quarter is concerned, that OTC category which grew in excess of 25%, if we were to exclude ZYRTEC from that category of sales, we would see low to mid-single-digit growth in that category.   
139677	20080415	1230	19	Okay then, how much of that growth do you think was stocking versus underlying usage?  
139677	20080415	1230	20	Well, probably a good two-thirds of the initial sales in the first quarter were attributed -- we believe are attributed to stocking.   
139677	20080415	1230	21	That’s very helpful. Okay, and then also just two other quick questions -- INVEGA, is that included in the RISPERDAL number or is that separate now?  
139677	20080415	1230	22	That’s separate now in Other.   
139677	20080415	1230	23	Okay, and you are not going to tell us what that number is?  
139677	20080415	1230	24	No, not right now.     
139677	20080415	1230	25	Okay, so all the other numbers you’ve given us in the past are going to be restated for that change?  
139677	20080415	1230	26	The numbers that you have in the schedule have your comparables for prior year.   
139677	20080415	1230	27	In prior quarters did INVEGA, was that included under the anti-psychotic number?  
139677	20080415	1230	28	Yes, it was. And the numbers --   
139677	20080415	1230	29	Okay, so we’re going to get restated schedules for all of the quarters going back or no?  
139677	20080415	1230	30	What we have given you here is 2007 restated to take INVEGA out. We certainly could give you -- break out the RISPERDAL Oral and we could put that up.   
139677	20080415	1230	31	Okay, we’ll do that later. And then R&D was only up around 4%. What do you expect growth in R&D to be up this year and why only 4%?  
139677	20080415	1230	32	Well, again Glenn, we won’t comment on individual line items like that because we manage the business throughout the 250 operating companies around the world and let them decide the proper level of spending in each of their categories, but generally speaking R&D growth will not be as pronounced as it has been in prior years. It will most likely be closer to the sales growth as opposed to the increased level of R&D spending you saw in prior years, as we now have built the pipeline as you saw and the products are now beginning to move through the regulatory process and off into the market.   
139677	20080415	1230	33	So you’re actually saying that pharma spending moderates during the next couple of years on an R&D --   
139677	20080415	1230	34	That’s probably -- that’s a good -- it will definitely moderate a bit from our prior several years growth in R&D, that’s right.   
139677	20080415	1230	35	Okay. Thank you very much.   
139677	20080415	1230	36	Thank you. Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	37	Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.   
139677	20080415	1230	38	Good morning. You did comment briefly on the procedures that you were seeing sort of at hospitals being maybe a tad lighter in Q1. I was just wondering if you could provide any commentary around sort of more capital equipment spending that you might detect. I know you guys don’t do too much of that but I would love to get any thoughts there.   
139677	20080415	1230	39	Actually, Tao, we -- as you know, our business is not capital intensive at all and so it would be not appropriate for me to comment on that part of the business, which we really don’t participate much in.   
139677	20080415	1230	40	Okay. And you also mentioned on drug eluting stents lower prices affecting you here in the U.S. I was just wondering if you could quantify that change.   
139677	20080415	1230	41	Sure and maybe Louise has it more readily available. If you look at price in drug eluting stents in this quarter versus last quarter of last year, it’s a decline on average of about 6%.   
139677	20080415	1230	42	Great, thanks. And then just lastly, any general thoughts on the recent district court decision in favor of Teva on generic RISPERDAL and whether -- how that impacts how you are thinking about RISPERDAL going generic in the back half of the year.   
139677	20080415	1230	43	Right. Well, we are obviously aware of the court decision that is favorable to Teva to grant them a 180-day exclusivity period. We would prefer to wait for the FDA to actually act because the FDA has not yet granted Teva that exclusivity period so I would prefer to wait and see how the FDA acts and then we’ll plan accordingly.   
139677	20080415	1230	44	But is it fair to -- I mean, if the FDA agrees with the courts, then that’s sort of a net positive for you guys versus your prior thinking?  
139677	20080415	1230	45	Sure, well, it’s always positive when you have less competitors in the market.   
139677	20080415	1230	46	Okay, great. Thanks.   
139677	20080415	1230	47	Thank you. Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	48	Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Lehman Brothers.   
139677	20080415	1230	49	Thanks and good morning. A couple of quick questions; first, Dominic, to go back to your comments about procedure growth during the quarter, was that spread evenly across Ethicon and Depuy or was that, your comments more focused on one versus the other, especially your comments on distributor inventory issues versus just overall slowdown? I was wondering if there was any further level of granularity you could provide there.   
139677	20080415	1230	50	Yeah, I think we saw lower procedure growth in general but I think probably in our Ethicon business more so than in the other businesses.   
139677	20080415	1230	51	Okay, so the inventory issue you are talking about is related more to Depuy than Ethicon than?  
139677	20080415	1230	52	Well, it’s been across the board, Bob, so we have to do some additional field checks but I think in terms of the overall growth or slower growth in procedures probably more in the general surgery are that we saw in our Ethicon business.   
139677	20080415	1230	53	Okay, thank you. That’s very helpful. And then on VELCADE and Millennium in light of the deal, I just want to be clear here -- should we expect the structure of your relationship with Millennium to change in any way as a result of this deal?  
139677	20080415	1230	54	Well, let’s break down the structure of the deal for you, that we -- hopefully this will be helpful. Outside the U.S., we have a broad arrangement with Millennium and as you know, we were the sole exclusive marketing partner outside the U.S. With respect to the current deal with Takeda that may take place, that deal will not be impacted in any way.   In the U.S., we actually co-promote VELCADE along with Millennium. That particular co-promote arrangement has various expiration dates. They are generally annual and then they can be renewed by either party on an annual basis, so we will have to wait and see what -- if the transaction goes through what the new thinking is on the part of our partner. We would be happy to continue co-promoting the product with Millennium or the new entity, as the case may be.   
139677	20080415	1230	55	Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful and then one final question -- given the launch of INTELENCE, I was wondering if you could provide any qualitative or quantitative thoughts on how we should think about that launch throughout the course of the rest of ’08 and into 2009.   
139677	20080415	1230	56	It’s probably too early, Bob, to give you any indication. We just launched it just a few months ago so I’d prefer to wait and see as we get more experience under our belt. I would say that the initial reaction by the medical community has been very positive, so we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.   
139677	20080415	1230	57	Thank you, Dominic. Appreciate it.   
139677	20080415	1230	58	Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	59	Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Goldman Sachs.   
139677	20080415	1230	60	Good morning. Dominic, I’m wondering if you could just review for us now where things stand with IONSYS, both in the U.S. and Europe. You obviously made some indications on the filing but I just want to kind of get an understanding where we stand.   
139677	20080415	1230	61	Sure. Well, IONSYS in Europe, we filed a manufacturing adjustment already, as you know, and it’s already been launched in Europe in seven countries, so it’s in the market in Europe. In the U.S., we just recently filed a manufacturing adjustment application with the FDA and we’ll have to wait for the FDA to take a look at that and we expect to hear back from them later this year.   
139677	20080415	1230	62	Okay, so it is possible that it could launch in the U.S. this year?  
139677	20080415	1230	63	Yeah, let’s just wait and see what the -- we work very closely with the FDA on it. Let’s just wait and see what the FDA has to say about our application.   
139677	20080415	1230	64	Okay, and then two other quick ones -- you certainly made some comments in the past, I think you’ve done some analysis around this where your consumer portfolio tends to do well during periods of economic challenges. But I just want to see how that was tracking in the first quarter and maybe you could take into account some of the comments about the decline in sales of Rembrandt as well as In-Reach toothbrushes. That’s question one.   And then question two, I know you are going to get a lot of questions about the procedure volume that you mentioned but just anecdotally as you speak to the business managers, any sense of why you might be seeing any change in procedure volumes this early in the year and again, early in the economic cycle?  
139677	20080415	1230	65	Okay, well first with respect to our consumer business, you are right. As we looked over the years at various economic cycles, our consumer business did not -- really did not correlate at all with any economic cycles, either up or down. So the business does not seem to be impacted by major trends in the economy.   You had asked about Rembrandt and Reach. We did have some slower growth in Rembrandt and Reach toothbrushes, which offset the very strong growth that we had in Listerine. Listerine is really the driver in our oral care business right now. It’s doing remarkably well for us, as we expected, bringing in a product of that heritage into our portfolio is very, very promising, so we are pleased with the outlook and the progress that we are making with Listerine.   With respect to procedure volumes, it is a little early to comment on it, Larry. I think there’s a number of factors going on here. The holiday schedule, for example, in the first quarter of this year was different than the first quarter of last year, so scheduling procedures may be a little different than it was year over year. There isn’t anything that stands out to us in terms of one particular category or one particular factor impacting procedure growth. We just saw a little bit slower procedure growth this quarter than we had seen in the first quarter of prior years. So a little too early to tell. We’ll have to wait and see what others report and we’ll get a better sense for the overall market after we see that.   
139677	20080415	1230	66	Okay, great. Thanks for the comments, guys.   
139677	20080415	1230	67	Thank you. Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	68	Your next question comes from the line of Michael Jungling with Merrill Lynch.   
139677	20080415	1230	69	Good morning, everyone. I have three questions. Firstly, can you give us the division EBIT for consumer, pharma, medical devices? Secondly, were you invited to make an offer for Alcon? And then thirdly, a question; if you did make another large acquisition, what is the upper limit that you are willing to go on a net debt to EBITDA? That would be great. Thank you.   
139677	20080415	1230	70	Michael, as you know we don’t really discuss the individual operating performance of the businesses. Rather, we give you an overall perspective on the enterprise and as you saw, we had very strong EBIT or pretax operating margins for the enterprise in the first quarter and we are pleased to see that the restructuring program we put in place last year has now been largely implemented and we see that in the operating margins for the entire business.   No comment on the -- on whether or not we were invited in any particular situation.   And lastly, with respect to acquisitions, the way we think about it, Michael, is in evaluating any limits, we don’t use the -- our Triple A credit rating, for example, as a limitation to our ability to make an appropriate offer for any acquisition that we would find attractive. Our primary criteria is whether or not the acquisition will generate significant shareholder value and in evaluating that, we take a look at whether or not the acquisition, proposed acquisition would generate a return sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital to compensate our shareholders for the risk. That’s our entire focus is on creating shareholder value and not necessarily on maintaining a particular level of debt or debt to equity ratio.   
139677	20080415	1230	71	And then just one final follow-up; if you look at the slow down in procedure growth that you’ve seen in the first quarter, how much of that could be the results of perhaps having less selling days in the first quarter?  
139677	20080415	1230	72	Well, that’s a great question, Michael and I was just commenting to Larry in the prior question that that did have some impact, that there were several days less shipping days in the quarter just because of the holiday schedule so that obviously had some impact. I can’t quantify it for you, however.   
139677	20080415	1230	73	Okay. Thank you.   
139677	20080415	1230	74	Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	75	Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.   
139677	20080415	1230	76	Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, on the gross margin, you were up pretty good year over year and Dominic, I just wanted to see if you could comment at all how much of that might have been related to foreign exchange and how much was related to the restructuring program.   And then the second question is on ACIPHEX/PARIET, that had a pretty big drop from what we even saw last year in the fourth quarter. So I guess my question there is was there any reversal in stocking in that kind of decline and is that the kind of run-rate we should expect, or is this a one-time drop of that magnitude?  
139677	20080415	1230	77	Okay, well with the gross margin, as you saw we did have a very favorable up-tick in gross margin this quarter versus the first quarter of last year. It’s really two items that impact that. One is that you may remember last year we brought in the Pfizer consumer healthcare business and in recording the acquisition price, there’s obviously some inventory step-up to fair market values. That was -- that negatively impacted first quarter gross margins, so the cost of those products were higher then. Obviously they have all now been sold through and so that accounting treatment has been fully taken into account by now, as we enter the first quarter of ’08.   And then secondly, the other part of the benefit is the cost restructuring program that we announced last year across most of our businesses. We’ve taken a hard look at some of the cost structure, as you know, and we’ve seen a benefit across all our businesses.   
139677	20080415	1230	78	And then how about ACIPHEX?  
139677	20080415	1230	79	ACIPHEX -- Louise, can you comment on ACIPHEX and the entry of generics into the marketplace?  
139677	20080415	1230	80	So the ACIPHEX in the U.S. is down about 27% and was your question regarding the inventory -- inventory differences is about half of that decline.   
139677	20080415	1230	81	Well, yeah because last -- I mean, even last year in the fourth quarter, you grew both in the U.S. and O-U.S. and then you had a huge drop down, so I guess globally is this the kind of -- is this a new level of decline we should expect or was there some reversals in inventory?  
139677	20080415	1230	82	Well, about half of the decline, as I said, is due to reversals in the inventory or changes in the inventory level but there is new competition in the PPI market in the U.S. in terms of a generic and we are seeing that same dynamic outside the U.S. Also in Canada, the PARIET, there is a generic of PARIET on the market now.   
139677	20080415	1230	83	Thanks, Louise. Thanks, Dominic.   
139677	20080415	1230	84	Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	85	Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wachovia.   
139677	20080415	1230	86	Thanks for taking my questions. Louise, drug eluting stent pricing in Europe on a constant currency basis, I think you gave the U.S. earlier.   
139677	20080415	1230	87	On an operational basis, O-U.S. is about 7% down.   
139677	20080415	1230	88	Thanks, and could you tell us what you think your share of the gastric banding market was in the quarter in the U.S. and how broadly you’ve rolled out the Realize brand? And then I have one question after that.   
139677	20080415	1230	89	Larry, as you know we are in the early stages of that launch so I -- we are probably not going to comment right now on market share there. In terms of how broadly it’s been rolled out, we have been undergoing physician training with respect to this launch. We’ve included in the launch plans a significant amount of physician training and education to ensure that the product is used appropriately, so we are just about through that now and then obviously we will continue to see further penetration of the product. It’s early though to give you any indication of share.   
139677	20080415	1230	90	And the U.S. filing for Rivaroxaban and Golimumab, could you just remind us of the dates on those two please? Thanks.   
139677	20080415	1230	91	Louise, why don’t you comment on those?  
139677	20080415	1230	92	Okay, so for Golimumab, it will be in the second quarter in the U.S. and for Rivaroxaban in the third quarter in the U.S.   
139677	20080415	1230	93	Thank you.   
139677	20080415	1230	94	Next question, please.   
139677	20080415	1230	95	Your next question comes from the line of Sara Michelmore with Cowen.   
139677	20080415	1230	96	Good morning. Can you talk about the environment for price increases in your pharmaceutical business? I know recently you did take a price increase on REMICADE in the U.S. Can you just talk about the environment in general and if there are any other product lines where you’ve been able to pass through price increases recently?  
139677	20080415	1230	97	Right. Well Sara, as you know this environment in general is a difficult environment to take price increases in. And really the area that you can take prices in is when you obviously show significant benefit or differentiation from other products in the market. So we believe to the extent that we have such differentiation and we believe many of our products do demonstrate value to the healthcare system, we’ll continue to look for price increases where appropriate.   But I would say the environment is not really conducive to price increases at all.   
139677	20080415	1230	98	Okay, and any other major product lines besides REMICADE in which you’ve been able to raise price recently?  
139677	20080415	1230	99	I don’t have the data in front of me, Sara, but we probably won’t comment on individual products.   
139677	20080415	1230	100	Okay. And in terms of CYPHER, I just wanted to clarify the U.S. market commentary there in particular, in terms of DDS utilization and PTCA volume declines. Could you just on a sequential basis give us a sense of what the trend there -- I know it was down significantly year over year but I’m just wondering if from your standpoint if that environment has stabilized or improved or deteriorated quarter to quarter.   
139677	20080415	1230	101	Right, so let me give you some insight into our estimate of the penetration rate in the U.S. for the first quarter is about 64%, and although that is significantly lower than the first quarter of ’07, we think it’s about a point higher than the fourth quarter of ’07. So that’s a good sign. It looks like the penetration rate sequentially now has stabilized.   And in terms of the overall procedure volume, I don’t have that information handy right now.   
139677	20080415	1230	102	Rough estimate is between the 10% and 15% range down in the quarter.   
139677	20080415	1230	103	Okay, okay and I guess we heading into the May medical meeting season. Any big data dissemination we should be paying attention to coming up at ASCO, DDW, APA -- any other meetings? I know specifically if you could comment on paliperidone palmitate and if we are going to see that Phase III data in the next couple of months.   
139677	20080415	1230	104	At APA, you will see a poster on Phase III data at APA. We’ve also got REMICADE -- sorry, Golimumab Phase III data RA at ULAR, and that’s in June in Paris. And that’s -- we’ve got some Tapentadol data also coming out later on in the quarter as well at APS in Tampa.   
139677	20080415	1230	105	I think a little further out, Sara, I think in September we’ll see Ustekinumab at a Durham meeting in comparison to [Embro] I think, right?  
139677	20080415	1230	106	Correct.   
139677	20080415	1230	107	Great. Thank you.  
139677	20080415	1230	108	Okay, and last question.   
139677	20080415	1230	109	Your last question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.  
139677	20080415	1230	110	Good morning. Ex-ZYRTEC stocking, what would you estimate the operational growth of consumer might have been?  
139677	20080415	1230	111	For the entire consumer sector, I just don’t have it handy but as we mentioned earlier in the OTC arena, that growth of 25 or some percent was obviously -- obviously benefited from the ZYRTEC launch and that growth would have been in the low to mid single digits.   
139677	20080415	1230	112	Okay, thank you. And with regard to the procedure slow down in surgery, general surgery I think you said, in prior periods of economic slow down have you seen that sort of effect before?  
139677	20080415	1230	113	Actually no. On a big picture perspective, all of our businesses actually have had very little correlation to economic trends. I would say we are in a little bit of a unique environment though today, so it’s hard to predict based on past practices but we are a little bit in a unique environment with this particular economic slowdown, so to predict what impact that would have now would be a little premature. It’s just early in the quarter and we just saw some early signs.   
139677	20080415	1230	114	I guess just to follow-up on that, why -- in what manner is this particularly unique?  
139677	20080415	1230	115	Well, you mean the overall economic slow down?  
139677	20080415	1230	116	Yes, from --   
139677	20080415	1230	117	Well, I think from my perspective, Bruce, what I see is the uncertainty in the credit markets being somewhat of an area of -- well, quite frankly uncertainty and then economic growth is a question mark as a result of that. We’ve seen this before in other economic cycles but I think you’d agree this one is a little bit more pronounced than we’ve seen in at least more recent economic cycles.   
139677	20080415	1230	118	But it wouldn’t necessarily tie to general surgical procedures or --   
139677	20080415	1230	119	Well, no, that’s what I -- that’s right and that’s what I mentioned. It’s not necessarily something that we have seen in the past and I’m not sure whether it’s something we are seeing now but it’s just early in the year and we’re giving you some insight into some early indicators that we saw in the first part of this year.   
139677	20080415	1230	120	I guess my final question is you know, you guys clearly have enormous financial resources and capacity to buy back shares, tighten the belt. But looking forward 1.5% to 2.5% operational growth is going to be problematic for stock progression. From your point of view, what are the organic growth drivers for the top line that you folks are most excited about? Thank you.   
139677	20080415	1230	121	Sure, Bruce and of course, the 1% to 2% you mentioned going forward, the 1% to 2% of course is this year’s operational growth rate. We’re not going to comment on what it would be going forward but we are excited about the overall robustness of the pipeline. And as we mentioned earlier in the call today, we’ve made very, very good progress on all fronts -- the medical device business is filing for new products, exciting products like the CAP system. We’ve begun the Sirolimus on the Conor stent clinical trial, which I think is an exciting new growth platform for us going forward. And as you know the pharma pipeline is not only robust, it’s progressing according to schedule and we are making the filings and dialoging with the health authority. And so we have a number of potential growth drivers already moving forward, consistent with our plans. And having said all that, during a time of some slow growth in the short-term period, we obviously feel like we took the appropriate disciplined actions for the business overall to account for that.   
139677	20080415	1230	122	Thanks so much.   
139677	20080415	1230	123	Okay. Great, well, thank you, everyone and thank you, Louise. Before we end this call, I would like to share some final thoughts on this quarter’s results. We are continuing to execute against the key priorities and pipeline opportunities we have recently outlined for you. Our progress on new products and new filings is moving along, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the extraordinary people across the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. We continue to invest in growth opportunities that are critical to our future while continuing to manage our costs and improve our operating margins.   I look forward to speaking with you again at our meeting on June 5th where we will focus on our medical devices and diagnostics businesses and also provide an update on the consumer business.   Thank you for your continued support of Johnson & Johnson and have a great day.   
139677	20080415	1230	124	Thank you. This concludes today’s Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.
