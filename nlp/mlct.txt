Hi Suvrat, 

We made an AI model at JPMorganChase touted as game changer for credit risk with prediction accuracy around 96%

1. It grades (AA+ thru C) companies based on their financial ratios

2. It can project portfolio performance in response to macro-economic scenarios
	for ex: Automobile book response vs CCAR Baseline FED-AUTO-Sales projection.


I'll be glad to speak with you how we can leverage use-case and datasets to created immediate value in your organization.


-Thanks,
